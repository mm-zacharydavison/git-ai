          "text": "Perfect! The code compiles successfully. Let me create a quick summary of the fix:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've fixed the bug where authorship attribution could be lost during rebase operations, particularly when commits are split or added during interactive rebases.\n\n### The Problem\nThe original code used `zip()` to pair up original and new commits in a 1:1 fashion. However, `zip()` truncates to the length of the shorter iterator. This meant:\n- When `original_commits.len() < new_commits.len()` (commit splitting or adding new commits), the extra new commits were **never processed**, losing their authorship attribution.\n\n### The Solution\nI modified `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase` in `src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs` to handle three distinct cases:\n\n1. **Many-to-few** (`original > new`): Squashing commits → uses `handle_squashed_rebase()`\n2. **Few-to-many** (`original < new`): **NEW** - Splitting/adding commits → uses new `handle_split_rebase()` \n3. **One-to-one** (`original == new`): Normal rebase → uses `zip()` safely\n\nI also added the `handle_split_rebase()` function which reconstructs authorship for all new commits by using the head of the original commits as the source, ensuring no attribution is lost during commit splitting or addition operations.\n\n### Changes Made\n- Modified `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase()` to explicitly handle all three mapping scenarios\n- Added `handle_split_rebase()` function to handle commit splitting/addition cases\n- Added debug logging to identify which rebase scenario is being processed\n\nThe fix ensures that all new commits from a rebase operation will have their authorship properly tracked, regardless of whether commits were squashed, split, or kept 1:1."
