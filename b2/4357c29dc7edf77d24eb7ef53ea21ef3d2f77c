This invalid runner is likely causing builds to fail or fall back to something unexpected.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n1. The `ubuntu-22.04-arm` runner doesn't exist, so that job is failing\n2. With `continue-on-error: true`, failed builds don't stop the workflow\n3. Either artifacts are getting mixed up, or the cache is contaminating builds\n\nYou're absolutely right - **Rosetta should NEVER appear in Linux binary errors**. That's macOS-specific!\n\nLet me fix this workflow with proper platform builds and add verification steps:",

This means it builds for the **native architecture** (aarch64-apple-darwin on M1/M2 macs)\n4. **Line 161**: It copies this **ARM binary** and names it `git-ai-macos-x64` \n\nSo you're building an ARM macOS binary and calling it x64!\n\nAlso, **line 16** has `continue-on-error: true` which means if the Linux build fails, it continues anyway and might not upload anything - then artifacts get mixed up.\n\nAnd the **cache on line 59** includes the `target` directory which could be causing cache pollution between builds.\n\nLet me fix the x86 builds properly:",
