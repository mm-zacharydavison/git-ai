Here's what I did:\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `assert_lines_and_blame` method now allows you to explicitly assert both line contents and authorship using the clean syntax you requested:\n\n```rust\nexample_txt.assert_lines_and_blame(lines![\n    \"contents of line 1\".ai(),\n    \"contents of line 2\".ai(),\n    \"contents of line 3\".human(),\n]);\n```\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Calls Real git-ai blame**: The method executes the actual `git-ai blame` command on the file\n2. **1:1 Line Comparison**: Compares each line's content AND authorship exactly\n3. **Detailed Error Messages**: If any assertion fails, you get:\n   - Which line number failed\n   - What was expected vs. actual (both content and authorship)\n   - The full blame output for debugging\n4. **Works with existing syntax**: Uses the existing `lines!` macro and `.ai()`/`.human()` extension methods\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nThe method:\n- Parses blame output to extract `(author, content)` tuples for each line\n- Compares the number of lines first\n- Then compares each line's content (trimmed) and authorship type\n- Provides clear, actionable error messages when assertions fail\n\nI've also added a test (`test_assert_lines_and_blame`) that demonstrates the usage, and it passes successfully! âœ…",
