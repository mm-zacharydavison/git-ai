Here's what I did:\n\n## Summary of Fixes\n\n1. **Added helper methods and traits to `InMemoryWorkingLog`** (`src/git/repo_storage.rs`):\n   - Added `is_empty()` and `len()` methods\n   - Implemented `Default` trait\n   - Implemented `IntoIterator` trait\n\n2. **Fixed `rebase_authorship.rs`**:\n   - Added import for `InMemoryWorkingLog`\n   - Changed `Vec::new()` to `InMemoryWorkingLog::default()`\n   - Fixed iteration to access `checkpoints.checkpoints` instead of directly iterating\n\n3. **Fixed `reset_hooks.rs`**:\n   - Added missing 7th parameter (`false`) to `checkpoint::run()` call\n   - Fixed iterations to access `.checkpoints` field from `InMemoryWorkingLog`\n\n4. **Removed unused imports** from `git_handlers.rs`:\n   - Removed `MergeSquashEvent` and `RewriteLogEvent` imports\n\nThe build now passes with only some pre-existing warnings about unused variables, which don't prevent compilation. âœ…"
