Now we need to migrate the remaining test files to use the same patterns.\nNew Testing API Overview\nImport structure:\nKey fixtures:\nTestRepo - Represents a git repository\nTestFile - Represents a file with expected authorship\nFluent file API:\nfile.set_contents(lines![...]) - Set initial file contents (handles AI/human attribution automatically via checkpoints)\nfile.insert_at(index, lines![...]) - Insert lines at position\nfile.replace_at(index, line) - Replace single line\nfile.delete_at(index) - Delete single line\nfile.delete_range(start, end) - Delete range [start..end)\nfile.stage() - Stage just this file\nfile.assert_lines_and_blame(lines![...]) - Main assertion for fully committed files\nfile.assert_committed_lines(lines![...]) - For partial staging tests (filters uncommitted lines)\nFluent repo API:\nrepo.filename(\"path.txt\") - Create/get a TestFile\nrepo.stage_all_and_commit(\"message\") - Stage all + commit (returns NewCommit)\nrepo.commit(\"message\") - Commit staged only (returns NewCommit)\nrepo.git(&[\"arg1\", \"arg2\"]) - Run git commands directly for edge cases\nrepo.git_ai(&[\"arg1\", \"arg2\"]) - Run git-ai commands directly\nLine macro:\nMigration Guidelines\nAll tests should be end-to-end - Use repo.git() and repo.git_ai() commands, let hooks handle authorship tracking\nKeep all test cases - Don't remove tests, just adapt them to the new API\nUse fluent assertions - Every test should end with assert_lines_and_blame() or assert_committed_lines()\nReduce snapshot dependency - Only use snapshots where necessary; prefer explicit assertions with the fluent API\nPartial staging pattern:\nRemove old imports - Delete unused imports like TmpRepo, LineRange (unless actually used), assert_debug_snapshot (unless keeping snapshots)\nExample Migration\nBefore (old TmpRepo API):\nAfter (new fluent API):\nSuccess Criteria\n[ ] All tests compile and pass\n[ ] No remaining TmpRepo references\n[ ] Every test ends with an assertion (usually assert_lines_and_blame or assert_committed_lines)\n[ ] Code is more readable - the test intent should be clear from the fluent API\n[ ] Partial staging tests use file.stage() + assert_committed_lines()\n[ ] No unused imports warnings\nTips\nStart simple: Migrate basic tests first to get familiar with the API\nFor complex operations (cherry-pick, rebase, reset): Use repo.git(&[\"command\", \"args\"]) for the git operations, then assert with the fluent API\nWhen stuck: Look at tests/simple_additions.rs for patterns\nAsk for help: If you need new helper methods in TestFile or TestRepo, ask!\n\n\nALSO REMEMBER. These are end-end tests. we are NEVER going to use internal methods, always use the provided ones from the test fixtures OR call repo.git or repo.git_ai directly. \n\n@test_repo.rs @test_file.rs \n\nExample @simple_additions.rs",
