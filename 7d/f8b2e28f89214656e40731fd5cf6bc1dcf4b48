Let me summarize what I've done:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the feature where `focus_on_working_log_files` uses `previously_edited_files` as pathspecs for all checkpoint operations. Here's what was changed:\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n1. **`src/commands/checkpoint.rs`**:\n   - Added `HashSet` to imports\n   - Created a `pathspecs` variable that gets set to `previously_edited_files` when `focus_on_working_log_files` is true\n   - Updated `get_all_files()` to accept and use `pathspecs: Option<&HashSet<String>>` parameter, which gets passed to `repo.status(pathspecs)`\n   - Updated `get_all_tracked_files()` to accept `pathspecs` parameter and pass it to `get_all_files()`\n   - Added logic in `get_all_tracked_files()` to filter files from previous checkpoints based on pathspecs\n\n2. **`src/commands/git_ai_handlers.rs`**:\n   - Updated the call to `checkpoint::run()` to include the 7th parameter `false` (not focusing on working log files by default)\n\n3. **`src/git/test_utils/mod.rs`**:\n   - Updated both `trigger_checkpoint_with_author()` and `trigger_checkpoint_with_ai()` to include the 7th parameter `false`\n\n### How It Works:\n\nWhen `focus_on_working_log_files` is `true` (which happens in the pre-commit hook):\n1. The checkpoint command reads the `previously_edited_files` from the working log\n2. These files are used as pathspecs for `git status`, limiting the status check to only those files\n3. The same pathspecs filter files from previous checkpoints, ensuring we only track changes in previously edited files\n4. This means tree diffs, status checks, and all other lookups are scoped to just the files that were previously edited\n\nThe feature is already being used in `src/authorship/pre_commit.rs` where it passes `true` for `focus_on_working_log_files`, which will now properly scope all checkpoint operations to the previously edited files for better performance.\n\nAll tests pass and there are no linter errors! âœ…"
