---

When you invoke the Git AI binary as `git` it will proxy the arguments to git and pipe the output and exist code back to you. 

To run Git AI specific commands you invoke the same binary as `git-ai`. The symlinks and $PATH export the install scripts setup sets all this up on your machine. 

```bash
git-ai <command> [options]
```

## User Commands

##### `blame`

Enhanced version of `git blame` that shows AI authorship attribution alongside traditional git blame.

```bash
git-ai blame <file>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<file>` - Path to the file to blame (required)

**Options:**
Mostly API Compatible, supports same options as [`git blame`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame). 


##### `stats`

Show AI authorship statistics for a commit. Displays how much code was written by humans vs AI.

```bash
# Show stats for current HEAD
git-ai stats

# Show stats for specific commit
git-ai stats <commit-sha>

# Output in JSON format
git-ai stats --json
git-ai stats <commit-sha> --json
```

**Options:**
- `<commit-sha>` - Optional commit SHA (defaults to HEAD)
- `--json` - Output statistics in JSON format

**Output**

When using `--json`, the command returns a JSON object with the following fields:

- **human_additions**: Number of lines in the commit attributed to humans (full or mixed). Calculated from final commit diff lines whose authorship attribution is human, including lines that originated from AI but were edited by a human before commit.
- **mixed_additions**: Number of AI-generated lines that were edited by humans before being committed. Calculated by intersecting AI-originated lines with human-edited changes prior to commit.
- **ai_additions**: Number of lines in the commit attributed to AI (full or mixed). Calculated from final commit diff lines with AI attribution, including lines later edited by humans.
- **ai_accepted**: Number of AI-generated lines committed without any human edits. Calculated as AI-originated lines that landed in the commit unchanged by humans.
- **total_ai_additions**: Total lines generated by AI while working toward this commit, whether or not they appear in the final diff. Includes accepted, mixed, and AI lines later removed during the session.
- **total_ai_deletions**: Total lines deleted by AI while working toward this commit, whether or not those deletions remain in the final diff.
- **time_waiting_for_ai**: Total wall-clock seconds spent waiting for AI responses during the commit’s working session(s).
- **git_diff_added_lines**: Raw number of added lines reported by the git diff for this commit.
- **git_diff_deleted_lines**: Raw number of deleted lines reported by the git diff for this commit.
- **tool_model_breakdown**: Object keyed by `<tool>:<model>` with per-tool metrics:
  - **ai_additions**, **mixed_additions**, **ai_accepted**, **total_ai_additions**, **total_ai_deletions**, **time_waiting_for_ai** (same definitions as above, scoped to that tool/model). For example, `cursor/gpt-5`

Notes:
- These categories are not mutually exclusive: for example, `mixed_additions` are counted in both `human_additions` and `ai_additions`, so `human_additions + ai_additions` can exceed `git_diff_added_lines`.
- Authorship is computed from tracked AI/human checkpoints and attribution over the final diff. “Mixed” means an AI-generated line was subsequently modified by a human before commit; “AI accepted” means an AI-generated line was committed without human edits.
- Empty lines are included in all statistics, for both humans and AI

##### `install-hooks`

Automatically configure Claude Code, Cursor and GitHub Copilot to send authorship information to the `git-ai` binary 

```bash
git-ai install-hooks
```


## Plumbing Commands (for AI Agents)

These commands are primarily used by AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) for authorship tracking. End users typically don't need to use these directly.

##### `checkpoint`

Checkpoint working changes and attribute them to an AI agent or human author.

```bash
# Basic checkpoint with preset
git-ai checkpoint <preset>

# Show the current working log
git-ai checkpoint --show-working-log

# Reset the working log
git-ai checkpoint --reset
```

**Presets:**
- `claude` - Claude AI integration
- `cursor` - Cursor editor integration
- `github-copilot` - GitHub Copilot integration
- `mock_ai` - Mock AI for testing

**Options:**
- `--show-working-log` - Display current working log without making changes
- `--reset` - Clear the working log

##### `squash-authorship`

Generate authorship information from squashed commits. Used when commits are squashed to reconstruct authorship metadata.

```bash
git-ai squash-authorship <branch> <new-sha> <old-sha>
git-ai squash-authorship <branch> <new-sha> <old-sha> --dry-run
```

**Arguments:**
- `<branch>` - Branch name (required)
- `<new-sha>` - New commit SHA after squash (required)
- `<old-sha>` - Old commit SHA before squash (required)

**Options:**
- `--dry-run` - Show what would be done without making changes

##### `git-path`

Print the path to the underlying git executable. Used by integrations to locate the git binary.

```bash
git-ai git-path
```

## Version

Show the version of git-ai:

```bash
git-ai version
git-ai --version
git-ai -v
```
