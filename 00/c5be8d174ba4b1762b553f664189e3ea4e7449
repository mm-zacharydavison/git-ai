Let me provide a summary of what the new test does:\n\n## Test Summary: `test_rebase_reword_commit_with_children`\n\nThe new test validates a complex rebase scenario:\n\n### Setup:\n1. **Creates 3 AI commits in sequence**:\n   - Commit 1: Adds `feature1.txt` (with AI authorship from gpt-4)\n   - Commit 2: Adds `feature2.txt` (child of commit 1, AI authorship from claude)\n   - Commit 3: Adds `feature3.txt` (grandchild of commit 1, AI authorship from gpt-4)\n\n2. **Advances the main branch** with a human commit\n\n3. **Performs an interactive rebase** that renames/rewords the first commit's message from \"AI commit 1 - original message\" to \"AI commit 1 - RENAMED MESSAGE\"\n\n### Verification:\nThe test then verifies that:\n- ✅ All 3 commits are preserved after the rebase\n- ✅ The first commit's message was successfully changed\n- ✅ **All 3 commits have their authorship logs properly preserved** (the key test requirement)\n- ✅ All files from all commits exist in the final tree\n- ✅ Parent-child relationships are correctly maintained (commit 2 → commit 1 → base)\n- ✅ File contents are intact and properly attributed\n\nThis test ensures that when you rebase and rename a commit with children, the entire chain of authorship/blame information is correctly maintained through the rebase operation. The test output shows the authorship reconstruction happening for all 3 commits, confirming the functionality works as expected."
