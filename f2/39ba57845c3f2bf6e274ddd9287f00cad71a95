The `collect_unstaged_hunks` function calls `repo.status()` on line 407, which in large repos like Chromium is extremely slow (5+ seconds) because it:\n\n1. Scans the entire working tree for untracked files\n2. Checks submodules\n3. Does extensive filesystem traversal\n\nHowever, you only need **unstaged changes in tracked files**, not a full status report.\n\nLet me search for how status is implemented to see if there's a faster alternative:"

          "type": "assistant",
          "text": "Perfect! I can see the issue. The `status()` method calls `git status --porcelain=v2` which scans the entire working tree, including looking for untracked files. This is very slow in large repos.\n\n## Analysis\n\nFor `collect_unstaged_hunks`, you only need **unstaged changes in tracked files**, not the full status report with untracked files. Looking at your timing data from Chromium:\n\n```\ntimer: collect_committed_hunks took 1.182901417s\ntimer: collect_unstaged_hunks took 5.09636s       ← The bottleneck\ntimer: convert_authorship_log_to_commit_coordinates took 2.875µs\n```\n\nThe `collect_unstaged_hunks` is 4x slower than `collect_committed_hunks`, which doesn't make sense since they're doing similar diff operations. The difference is the `repo.status()` call.\n\n## Solutions\n\nI have a few questions to understand the best approach:\n\n1. **Quick win: Use `git diff-files` instead of full status?**\n   - a) Yes - Replace `status()` with a faster method that only checks tracked files (recommended - likely 10x faster)\n   - b) No - I need the full status information including untracked files\n\n2. **Do you ever have unstaged changes after a commit in your workflow?**\n   - a) Rarely - I usually commit everything (we could add a fast-path check for this common case)\n   - b) Commonly - Often have unstaged changes remaining after partial commits\n\n3. **Alternative approach: Can we avoid needing unstaged hunks entirely?**\n   - a) Explore rewriting the coordinate conversion logic to work differently\n   - b) Keep current approach but optimize the status call\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nThe fastest fix is **option 1a**: Replace `repo.status()` in `collect_unstaged_hunks` with `git diff-files`, which:\n- Only checks tracked files (no untracked file scanning)\n- Should be 10-20x faster in large repos\n- Gives you the exact same information you need (unstaged changes)\n\nThis would be a 2-line change in the `collect_unstaged_hunks` function, replacing the `repo.status()` call with a new `repo.diff_files()` method that runs `git diff-files --name-status -z` or similar.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this approach, or do you have a different preference?"

Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n### 1. **Added `Repository::diff_files()` method** (`src/git/status.rs`)\n- New public method that runs `git diff-files --name-only -z`\n- Returns only file paths with unstaged changes (no untracked file scanning)\n- Includes a fast parser `parse_diff_files()` that handles null-separated output\n- Lines 74-107\n\n### 2. **Updated `collect_unstaged_hunks()`** (`src/authorship/post_commit.rs`)\n- Replaced `repo.status()` call with `repo.diff_files()` (line 407)\n- Simplified loop to iterate over file paths directly (line 415)\n- Removed unused imports: `EntryKind` and `StatusCode` (line 9)\n- All other logic remains unchanged\n\n## Expected Performance Improvement\n\nIn large repos like Chromium:\n- **Before**: ~5 seconds (full status scan including untracked files)\n- **After**: ~100-500ms (only checks tracked files with unstaged changes)\n- **Speed up**: 10-50x faster\n\nThe key optimization is that `git diff-files` only checks the index against the working directory for tracked files, completely avoiding the expensive filesystem traversal for untracked files that `git status` performs.\n\nYou can test this in your Chromium repo with the next commit to see the performance improvement!"

That's slow!\n\n## Better approach: Use `git diff-files` with patch output\n\nInstead of:\n1. Getting list of files\n2. Reading each file's blob\n3. Reading each file from disk  \n4. Running TextDiff ourselves\n\nWe can:\n1. Run `git diff-files` with unified diff output\n2. Parse the hunks directly from git's output (git already computed the diff!)\n3. Extract line numbers from the hunks\n\nThis would be **much** faster because git's internal diff is highly optimized.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- **Option A**: Refactor `collect_unstaged_hunks` to use `git diff-files` patch output instead of doing our own TextDiff\n- **Option B**: Look at refactoring all three functions to share tree lookups and potentially combine some operations\n- **Option C**: Profile more to see exactly where the 2s is being spent in `collect_unstaged_hunks`\n\nI'm leaning toward **Option A** as it should give us the biggest win with minimal changes."

Let me create a summary of the refactoring:\n\n## Summary of Optimizations\n\nI've successfully refactored `post_commit.rs` to use git's native diff instead of our own TextDiff computations. Here's what changed:\n\n### **New Methods Added to `Repository` (in `src/git/status.rs`)**\n\n1. **`diff_tree_to_tree_hunks(from_sha, to_sha)`** - Gets line ranges for changes between two commits using `git diff`\n2. **`diff_head_to_workdir_hunks()`** - Gets line ranges for unstaged changes using `git diff HEAD`\n3. **`parse_unified_diff_hunks()`** - Parses unified diff output (`@@ -a,b +c,d @@` headers) to extract line numbers\n\n### **Refactored Functions (in `src/authorship/post_commit.rs`)**\n\n1. **`collect_committed_hunks()`** \n   - **Before**: Used libgit2 to read trees → read blobs → compute TextDiff for each file\n   - **After**: Single `git diff parent..commit` call, parse hunks directly\n   - Removed ~180 lines of manual diff logic\n\n2. **`collect_unstaged_hunks()`**\n   - **Before**: Called `repo.status()` (5s in Chromium) → read blobs → compute TextDiff for each file\n   - **After**: Single `git diff HEAD` call, parse hunks directly  \n   - Removed ~80 lines of manual diff logic\n\n### **Why This Is Much Faster**\n\n1. **Git skips identical files** - If blob hashes match, git doesn't even read the content\n2. **Git's diff is in C** - Highly optimized, uses efficient algorithms\n3. **One git call vs many** - We make 1-2 git calls total instead of N+1 (where N = files changed)\n4. **No status scan** - We don't scan for untracked files (was taking 5+ seconds in Chromium)\n\n### **Expected Performance in Chromium**\n\nBased on your timings:\n```\nBefore:\n- filter_untracked_files: 896ms\n- collect_committed_hunks: 1.2s  \n- collect_unstaged_hunks: 2s\nTotal: ~4.1s\n\nExpected After:\n- filter_untracked_files: ~896ms (unchanged)\n- collect_committed_hunks: ~50-100ms (git diff between commits)\n- collect_unstaged_hunks: ~50-100ms (git diff HEAD)\nTotal: ~1-1.2s\n\nSpeedup: 3-4x faster\n```\n\nThe code is now ready to test! Try making a commit in your Chromium repo and check the new timings. The performance should be dramatically better, especially for `collect_committed_hunks` and `collect_unstaged_hunks`."
