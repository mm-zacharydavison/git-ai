Let me analyze the code paths:\n\n**`collect_committed_hunks`** (lines 229-399):\n- Diffs parent commit tree vs current commit tree\n- Uses `diff_tree_to_tree` to get deltas\n- Reads blob content from both trees via git objects\n- Uses `TextDiff` to find inserted lines\n\n**`collect_unstaged_hunks`** (lines 406-492):\n- Diffs current commit tree (HEAD) vs working directory files\n- Uses `repo.status()` to find unstaged files\n- Reads blob content from HEAD tree and filesystem\n- Uses `TextDiff` to find inserted lines\n\nThey do share similar logic:\n1. Get two versions of files (from different sources)\n2. Run `TextDiff::from_lines`\n3. Iterate changes, track line numbers for insertions\n4. Compress to `LineRange` format\n5. Return `HashMap<String, Vec<LineRange>>`\n\nHowever, they can't easily be the same function because:\n- Different data sources (tree-to-tree vs tree-to-workdir)\n- Different git operations (`diff_tree_to_tree` vs `status` + file reads)\n- `collect_committed_hunks` handles initial commits specially\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Would you prefer to:\n   - a) Keep them separate (current approach, clearer semantics)\n   - b) Merge into one function returning `(committed, unstaged)` tuple\n   - c) Extract common diffing logic into a helper function both can use\n\n2. If merging: Should the combined function do both operations always, or take a parameter to specify which?\n\nThe pathspec optimization will help both equally. Merging them might save a bit of code duplication but could make the logic harder to follow. What's your preference?"

We iterate through all changes manually tracking line numbers\n\nIn a large commit, this could be hundreds of files, and if any are large (like generated files, vendor code, etc.), it's extremely slow.\n\nInstead, we should use `git diff` or `git diff-tree` with the **unified diff format** which already gives us the line numbers. The output looks like:\n\n```\n@@ -10,5 +15,8 @@\n```\n\nThis means: old file starting at line 10 (5 lines), new file starting at line 15 (8 lines). We just need to parse these hunk headers to extract which lines were added.\n\nShould I:\n1. **Create a new helper function** that runs `git diff-tree` with `-U0` (unified format, 0 context lines) and parses the `@@` hunk headers to extract line numbers directly?\n2. **Replace the blob fetching + TextDiff logic** with this approach in both `collect_committed_hunks` and `collect_unstaged_hunks`?\n\nThis should be MUCH faster since we're letting git do all the heavy lifting and just parsing its output.\n\nWant me to implement this optimization?"

Let me create a summary of what we've accomplished:\n\n## Optimization Complete! 🚀\n\n### What We Changed\n\nI replaced the slow blob-fetching + TextDiff approach with direct git diff parsing:\n\n#### **Before:**\n- `collect_committed_hunks`: ~170 lines\n  - Called `diff_tree_to_tree` to get list of changed files\n  - For EACH file: fetched full blob content from parent tree\n  - For EACH file: fetched full blob content from current tree  \n  - For EACH file: ran `TextDiff::from_lines()` (expensive!)\n  - Manually tracked line numbers through diff changes\n\n- `collect_unstaged_hunks`: ~90 lines\n  - Called `repo.status()` to get unstaged files\n  - For EACH file: fetched full blob from HEAD\n  - For EACH file: read full file from disk\n  - For EACH file: ran `TextDiff::from_lines()`\n  - Manually tracked line numbers\n\n#### **After:**\n- `collect_committed_hunks`: **33 lines**\n  - Single call to `repo.diff_added_lines(parent, commit, pathspecs)`\n  - Git computes diff with `-U0` and we parse hunk headers\n  - Returns line numbers directly\n\n- `collect_unstaged_hunks`: **17 lines**\n  - Single call to `repo.diff_workdir_added_lines(commit, pathspecs)`\n  - Git computes diff against working directory\n  - Returns line numbers directly\n\n### New Helper Functions in `repository.rs`\n\n1. **`diff_added_lines(from_ref, to_ref, pathspecs)`**\n   - Runs `git diff -U0` between two commits\n   - Parses unified diff hunk headers (`@@ -10,2 +15,5 @@`)\n   - Returns `HashMap<String, Vec<u32>>` of added line numbers per file\n\n2. **`diff_workdir_added_lines(from_ref, pathspecs)`**\n   - Runs `git diff -U0` between commit and working directory\n   - Same parsing logic\n   - Returns added line numbers in working directory\n\n3. **`parse_diff_added_lines(diff_output)`**\n   - Parses git diff unified format output\n   - Extracts file paths and line numbers from `@@` headers\n\n4. **`parse_hunk_header(line)`**\n   - Parses `@@ -old_start,old_count +new_start,new_count @@`\n   - Returns vector of added line numbers\n\n### Expected Performance\n\nYour previous results:\n- `filter_untracked_files`: 969ms\n- `collect_committed_hunks`: 1.23s  \n- `collect_unstaged_hunks`: 250ms\n\n**Expected after this optimization:**\n- `collect_committed_hunks`: **~10-50ms** (98% reduction!)\n- `collect_unstaged_hunks`: **~5-20ms** (92% reduction!)\n\nThe speedup comes from:\n1. **No blob fetching**: Git doesn't need to retrieve full file contents\n2. **No TextDiff computation**: Git's native diff is written in C and highly optimized\n3. **Direct parsing**: We just parse hunk headers, not entire file contents\n4. **Pathspec filtering**: Still scoped to only edited files\n\nTry it out and let me know the new timings!"
