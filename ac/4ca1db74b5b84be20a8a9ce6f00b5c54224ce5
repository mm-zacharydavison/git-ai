Let me create a quick summary of the fix:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've fixed the bug where authorship attribution could be lost during rebase operations, particularly when commits are split or added during interactive rebases.\n\n### The Problem\nThe original code used `zip()` to pair up original and new commits in a 1:1 fashion. However, `zip()` truncates to the length of the shorter iterator. This meant:\n- When `original_commits.len() < new_commits.len()` (commit splitting or adding new commits), the extra new commits were **never processed**, losing their authorship attribution.\n\n### The Solution\nI modified `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase` in `src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs` to handle three distinct cases:\n\n1. **Many-to-few** (`original > new`): Squashing commits → uses `handle_squashed_rebase()`\n2. **Few-to-many** (`original < new`): **NEW** - Splitting/adding commits → uses new `handle_split_rebase()` \n3. **One-to-one** (`original == new`): Normal rebase → uses `zip()` safely\n\nI also added the `handle_split_rebase()` function which reconstructs authorship for all new commits by using the head of the original commits as the source, ensuring no attribution is lost during commit splitting or addition operations.\n\n### Changes Made\n- Modified `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase()` to explicitly handle all three mapping scenarios\n- Added `handle_split_rebase()` function to handle commit splitting/addition cases\n- Added debug logging to identify which rebase scenario is being processed\n\nThe fix ensures that all new commits from a rebase operation will have their authorship properly tracked, regardless of whether commits were squashed, split, or kept 1:1."

Fixed `build_rebase_commit_mappings` in `git_handlers.rs` (lines 531-533)**\n- Removed the lossy special case that kept only the last commit\n- Now passes ALL commits through to the authorship rewriting logic\n- Simplified the code to let the authorship layer handle different mapping scenarios\n\n**2. Enhanced `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase` in `rebase_authorship.rs` (lines 322-383)**\n- Added detection for many-to-few mappings (`original_commits.len() > new_commits.len()`)\n- Created new `handle_squashed_rebase()` function to properly reconstruct authorship when commits are squashed\n- For squashed commits, uses the head of original commits (which contains all accumulated changes) to reconstruct authorship for each new commit\n- Maintains the existing 1:1 mapping logic for normal rebases\n\n### Result\n- ✅ Authorship information from all original commits is now preserved during squashing\n- ✅ Handles N→1 squashing (multiple commits to one)\n- ✅ Handles N→M squashing (multiple commits to fewer commits)\n- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with 1:1 rebases\n- ✅ Code compiles successfully with no new warnings\n\nThe fix ensures that when performing interactive rebases with squashing, the authorship reconstruction will use the complete history from all original commits rather than losing information from all but the last commit."
