When building for different targets, you might have cached artifacts from an Apple Silicon build bleeding into Linux builds.\n\nHere are the issues I see:\n\n1. **Insufficient cache specificity** - The cache key should include the target architecture to prevent cross-platform contamination\n2. **`ubuntu-20.04` might be running on Apple Silicon runners** - GitHub Actions' runners can be Apple Silicon-based now\n\n**I recommend these fixes:**\n\n```yaml\n- name: Cache dependencies\n  uses: actions/cache@v4\n  with:\n    path: |\n      ~/.cargo/registry\n      ~/.cargo/git\n      target\n    key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ matrix.target }}-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}\n    restore-keys: |\n      ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ matrix.target }}-\n```\n\nAlso, add a **verification step** to ensure the binary is actually Linux x86_64:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Verify binary format\n  if: contains(matrix.os, 'ubuntu')\n  run: |\n    file target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/git-ai\n    readelf -h target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/git-ai || ldd target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/git-ai\n```\n\nWould you like me to update the workflow file with these fixes? This should resolve the Rosetta error by ensuring:\n1. Each target gets its own cache namespace\n2. You can verify the binary format before uploading",

Now each architecture has its own cache namespace, so:\n- Ubuntu builds will ONLY use Linux x86_64 artifacts\n- macOS builds will ONLY use macOS artifacts\n- No cross-contamination\n\nThe verification step will also catch this in the future by printing the actual binary format and architecture, so you'll immediately see if something goes wrong.\n\nTry re-running the workflow and it should generate a proper Linux x86_64 binary that works in your Docker container!",
