The new structure provides a more flexible and unified way to track all types of git reset operations with their various flags."

Let me create a quick summary of the fix:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've fixed the bug where authorship attribution could be lost during rebase operations, particularly when commits are split or added during interactive rebases.\n\n### The Problem\nThe original code used `zip()` to pair up original and new commits in a 1:1 fashion. However, `zip()` truncates to the length of the shorter iterator. This meant:\n- When `original_commits.len() < new_commits.len()` (commit splitting or adding new commits), the extra new commits were **never processed**, losing their authorship attribution.\n\n### The Solution\nI modified `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase` in `src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs` to handle three distinct cases:\n\n1. **Many-to-few** (`original > new`): Squashing commits → uses `handle_squashed_rebase()`\n2. **Few-to-many** (`original < new`): **NEW** - Splitting/adding commits → uses new `handle_split_rebase()` \n3. **One-to-one** (`original == new`): Normal rebase → uses `zip()` safely\n\nI also added the `handle_split_rebase()` function which reconstructs authorship for all new commits by using the head of the original commits as the source, ensuring no attribution is lost during commit splitting or addition operations.\n\n### Changes Made\n- Modified `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase()` to explicitly handle all three mapping scenarios\n- Added `handle_split_rebase()` function to handle commit splitting/addition cases\n- Added debug logging to identify which rebase scenario is being processed\n\nThe fix ensures that all new commits from a rebase operation will have their authorship properly tracked, regardless of whether commits were squashed, split, or kept 1:1."

The file path lookups are the bottleneck, not the data structure choice.\n\nIf you want sorted iteration, you could always call `.keys().collect::<Vec<_>>().sort()` when needed, rather than paying the O(log n) cost on every lookup.",

In a merge scenario you'd probably use\ngit diff --name-only <commit> <commit>\nto figure out what's in scope.\nAs it builds the struct it does a blame on each file in parallel and builds the attributions.\n--- that lets us get pairs for the ops we care about\nFor squash operations\nbase HEAD\nHEAD of feature branch\nFor reset we'd have\nHEAD + working log\nreset target\nRebase it's\nHEAD (dirty heads will be blocked by git so safe to assume clean) --> we'll compute pre-commit and save it to file system. We can resolve the list of all the commits being considered in pre-rebase hook and use the union of their pathspecs to build it.\nnew HEAD (using same union). we might drop any AI conflict resolutions but who cares...\nCherrypick it's\ncommit we're targeting plus pathspecs\nHEAD + working log\n---- and then we need some merge code\nI'm still fuzzy on it, but it feels like you give it to the final form of the file (always known), it each lineage computes its diff to that version and adjusts its authorship\nThen we have two separate attestations for the same file. WE favor one lineage when merging, and if there's a gap either of them can fill it\n2:00\nIf that's right, roughly speaking then the rewrite code for everything looks like\nlet a = VirtualAttestations::from_repo_state(pathspecs)\nlet b = VirtualAttestations::from_commit(pathspecs)\n\n// often A, but sometimes not if there was a conflict resolved. we might even be able to have this be a method of a\nlet final_state = get_final_state_for_pathspec(pathspecs)\n\nlet attestation = merge_attestations_favoring_first(a, b, final_state)\n\n// use this for rebase, ammend, merge --squash\nattestation.to_authorship_log()\n// use this for cherry picks or reset --softs\nattestation.to_initial_working_log_state()\n\n\nlet's build all the pieces, including the merge_attestations_favoring_first.

The pattern is now:\n\n```rust\n// Before (required passing head_sha):\nlet a = VirtualAttributions::from_repo_state(repo, head_sha, pathspecs).await?;\n\n// After (automatically gets HEAD):\nlet a = VirtualAttributions::from_repo_state(repo, pathspecs).await?;\n```\n\nThis is much cleaner and follows the principle of using the repository's built-in helpers rather than requiring external callers to manage Git references manually.",

In our `to_authorship_log()` method, we're creating a **new** AuthorshipLog:\n\n```rust\nlet mut authorship_log = AuthorshipLog::new();\n```\n\nBut we should be using the authorship log that already has the attestations from the checkpoint application! The checkpoint application happens in `from_working_log_for_commit`, but then we're throwing away that authorship log and creating a new one in `to_authorship_log()`.\n\nThe issue is that our VirtualAttributions doesn't store the authorship log - it only stores the line attributions. But the authorship log also needs the prompt records, which come from the checkpoint application.\n\nLet me fix this by modifying the VirtualAttributions to store the authorship log, or by changing the approach. Actually, let me first check what the original implementation was doing by looking at the old code that was working.\n\nThe original implementation was applying checkpoints directly to an authorship log and then returning that log.

Instead of trying to convert line attributions back to an authorship log, let me modify the merge logic to work with authorship logs directly.\n\nActually, let me take a step back and fix this more simply.

Here's what was implemented:\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **New Method**: `VirtualAttributions::from_working_log_for_commit()`\n   - Returns both the VirtualAttributions and the AuthorshipLog with applied checkpoints\n   - Takes a `human_author` parameter to properly attribute checkpoints\n   - Applies working log checkpoints to the base commit's authorship log\n\n2. **Simplified Amend Logic** in `rebase_authorship.rs`:\n   - Uses `from_working_log_for_commit()` to get the authorship log with checkpoints applied\n   - Updates the base commit SHA to the amended commit\n   - Saves the authorship log\n\n3. **Clean Implementation**:\n   - Removed all debug logging\n   - Simplified the approach - no complex merge needed for amends\n   - All 4 amend tests pass successfully\n\n### Test Results:\n```\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_add_lines_at_bottom ... ok\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_add_lines_in_middle ... ok\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_add_lines_at_top ... ok\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_multiple_changes ... ignored (as expected)\n```\n\nThe new implementation is much simpler than the original complex diff-based approach, and it correctly preserves AI authorship attributions through commit amends.

          "text": "Perfect! Now I can explain how the `human_author` parameter is used:\n\n## How `human_author` is Used\n\nThe `human_author` parameter is used to properly attribute AI-generated content to the human who initiated the AI session. Here's how it works:\n\n### 1. **Prompt Record Creation**\nWhen applying checkpoints, the system creates `PromptRecord` entries in the authorship log's metadata. The `human_author` parameter is used to set the `human_author` field in these records:\n\n```rust\nlet entry = self.metadata\n    .prompts\n    .entry(session_id.clone())\n    .or_insert(PromptRecord {\n        agent_id: agent.clone(),\n        human_author: human_author.map(|s| s.to_string()), // ← Used here\n        messages: transcript.messages().to_vec(),\n        total_additions: 0,\n        total_deletions: 0,\n        accepted_lines: 0,\n        overriden_lines: 0,\n    });\n```\n\n### 2. **Why This Matters**\nThe `human_author` field tracks who was responsible for initiating the AI session. This is important for:\n\n- **Accountability**: Knowing which human user requested the AI assistance\n- **Audit trails**: Tracking who authorized AI-generated changes\n- **Attribution**: Properly crediting both the AI agent and the human who used it\n\n### 3. **In the Amend Context**\nIn our commit amend implementation, we pass the actual human author from the commit:\n\n```rust\nVirtualAttributions::from_working_log_for_commit(\n    repo_clone,\n    original_commit.to_string(),\n    &pathspecs,\n    Some(_human_author.clone()), // ← Pass the actual human author\n)\n```\n\nThis ensures that when we apply checkpoints during an amend, the resulting authorship log correctly shows:\n- **AI agent**: The AI that generated the code (e.g., \"cursor\", \"gpt-4\")\n- **Human author**: The actual person who made the commit (e.g., \"Test User <test@example.com>\")\n\n### 4. **Test Verification**\nThis is why our test was failing initially - it expected:\n```rust\nhuman_author: Some(\"Test User <test@example.com>\")\n```\n\nBut we were getting:\n```rust\nhuman_author: Some(\"human\")  // From CheckpointKind::Human.to_str()\n```\n\nBy passing the actual human author parameter, we now get the correct attribution in the final authorship log.\n\nThe `human_author` parameter essentially bridges the gap between the technical checkpoint system (which uses generic identifiers) and the human-readable authorship tracking that users expect to see.",

It's about **tracking who initiated the AI session** for audit/accountability purposes.\n\nHere's what actually happens:\n\n## Content Attribution (Lines/Characters)\n- **AI-generated lines**: Still attributed to the AI agent (e.g., \"976aa32\" for cursor/gpt-4)\n- **Human-written lines**: Still attributed to \"human\" \n- **Mixed lines**: Split between AI and human based on who wrote each part\n\n## Human Author Field (Metadata)\nThe `human_author` parameter only affects the **metadata** in the `PromptRecord`:\n\n```rust\nPromptRecord {\n    agent_id: agent.clone(),           // AI agent info\n    human_author: human_author.map(|s| s.to_string()), // ← Only this field\n    messages: transcript.messages().to_vec(),\n    // ... other fields\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nIn our test, the final authorship log shows:\n\n```rust\n// Line attributions (content)\nline_ranges: [Range(6, 7)]  // Lines 6-7 attributed to AI agent \"976aa32\"\n\n// Prompt metadata (session info)  \nprompts: {\n    \"976aa32\": PromptRecord {\n        agent_id: AgentId { tool: \"cursor\", id: \"ai_agent\", model: \"gpt-4\" },\n        human_author: Some(\"Test User <test@example.com>\"), // ← Who initiated the AI session\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe `human_author` field answers: **\"Who was responsible for this AI session?\"**\n\n- **Lines 6-7**: Written by AI agent \"976aa32\" \n- **Session responsibility**: \"Test User <test@example.com>\" initiated the AI session\n\nThis is important for:\n- **Audit trails**: Knowing which human authorized AI changes\n- **Accountability**: Tracking who used AI assistance\n- **Compliance**: Meeting requirements for AI-generated content attribution\n\nSo the `human_author` parameter doesn't change **what** content is attributed to whom - it just tracks **who** was responsible for initiating the AI session that generated that content.",

Let me verify this by checking what happens in our test case:\n\n## Test Case Analysis\n\nIn our test:\n1. **Original commit**: Made by \"Test User <test@example.com>\" (human author)\n2. **AI checkpoint**: Created with AI agent, but no existing authorship log\n3. **Amend**: We pass \"Test User <test@example.com>\" as `human_author`\n\nSince there's no existing authorship log for the original commit, the prompt record gets created with the `human_author` we pass.\n\n## The Real Issue\n\nThe issue you're pointing out would occur if:\n1. **Original commit**: Made by Alice, with AI content\n2. **Amend**: Made by Bob\n3. **Our code**: Passes Bob as `human_author`\n\nIn this case, Bob would overwrite Alice's attribution for the AI sessions.\n\n## The Correct Fix\n\nWe should **not** pass the amending user as `human_author`.

In an amend scenario, we're not creating new checkpoints during the amend process. The amend just applies the existing working log checkpoints to the authorship log.\n\nSo actually, we should pass `None` to preserve the original human attribution, and the amending user doesn't need to be attributed to any AI content since they're not creating new AI content - they're just applying existing checkpoints.\n\nWould you like me to make this fix?",

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### ✅ **Human Author Attribution Fix**\n\n**Problem**: The `human_author` parameter was being applied to all AI sessions, including ones from the original commit, which would overwrite the original human attribution.\n\n**Solution**: Implemented smart logic that:\n- **Preserves original attribution**: If the original commit has existing AI sessions with human authors, those are preserved (`None` passed to avoid overwriting)\n- **Applies to new content**: If the original commit has no AI sessions (empty authorship log), the amending user is used as the human author\n\n**Logic**:\n```rust\nlet has_existing_prompts = if has_existing_log {\n    let original_log = get_reference_as_authorship_log_v3(repo, original_commit).unwrap();\n    !original_log.metadata.prompts.is_empty()\n} else {\n    false\n};\n\n// Only use amending user if no existing AI sessions to preserve\nif has_existing_prompts { None } else { Some(_human_author.clone()) }\n```\n\n### ✅ **Code Cleanup**\n\n- Removed all debug logging\n- Cleaned up unused imports (`merge_attributions_favoring_first`, `HashMap`)\n- Removed unused commit objects\n- Simplified the implementation\n\n### ✅ **Test Results**\n\nAll amend tests pass:\n```\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_add_lines_at_bottom ... ok\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_add_lines_in_middle ... ok  \ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_add_lines_at_top ... ok\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_multiple_changes ... ignored\n```\n\n### **Final Behavior**\n\nThe commit amend logic now correctly:\n1. **Preserves original human attribution** for existing AI sessions\n2. **Applies amending user attribution** only to new AI sessions (when no existing sessions exist)\n3. **Maintains proper audit trails** showing who initiated each AI session\n4. **Uses the Virtual Attribution system** for cleaner, more maintainable code\n\nThe implementation is now ready for use and properly handles the human author attribution as requested!",

Let me summarize what I've learned:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n1. **CherryPickEvent already exists** in `rewrite_log.rs` but is unused\n2. **No cherry-pick hooks exist** - need to create them\n3. **Pattern from rebase** is well-established:\n   - Pre-hook captures original state\n   - Post-hook detects completion/abort/in-progress\n   - Uses Start/Complete/Abort event pattern for multi-step operations\n   - Uses rewrite log to track state across continuations\n4. **Git cherry-pick state tracking**:\n   - `.git/CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` exists during conflicts or multi-commit picks\n   - `.git/sequencer/` directory tracks multi-commit sequence\n5. **Authorship reconstruction approach**: hanging commit + blame is proven\n\n## Questions for the user:\n\nBefore creating the plan, I need to clarify the event structure for cherry-pick since the current `CherryPickEvent` only tracks a single commit, but cherry-pick can apply multiple commits.\n\n1. For the rewrite log events, should we follow the rebase pattern with Start/Complete/Abort events, or use the simpler single-event pattern like the existing CherryPickEvent?\n   - a) Rebase-style: CherryPickStart, CherryPickComplete, CherryPickAbort (tracks multiple commits as a sequence)\n   - b) Single event: Keep existing CherryPickEvent structure (one event per commit)\n\n2. When cherry-picking multiple commits (e.g., `git cherry-pick A B C`), how should we structure the mapping?\n   - a) Process all at completion as a batch with array of (source_commit -> new_commit) mappings\n   - b) Process each commit individually as it's created (similar to how rebase processes commit-by-commit)"

Let me clarify the mapping logic in the plan:\n\nWhen `git cherry-pick A B C` runs:\n- A gets applied to current HEAD → creates A'\n- B gets applied to A' → creates B' \n- C gets applied to B' → creates C'\n\n**For the implementation:**\n\nThe **git command itself** handles the sequential shifting (A → A', B on top of A' → B', etc.). We don't need to manually iterate during authorship reconstruction.\n\nIn our hooks:\n1. **Pre-hook**: Capture original_head and source_commits [A, B, C]\n2. **Git does its thing** (sequential application with potential conflicts/continues)\n3. **Post-hook**: Build mapping by walking from new_head back to original_head to get [A', B', C'], then zip with [A, B, C] to get pairs\n\nThe authorship reconstruction for each pair is independent because each new commit already has the correct tree (git already applied the changes). We just use the source commit as the \"blame context\" via the hanging commit approach.\n\n**One edge case to handle**: If there are conflicts and the user resolves/continues multiple times, the sequencer tracks this. The post-hook detects \"still in progress\" via `.git/sequencer/` existing and waits. Only when fully complete (sequencer gone) do we build final mappings.\n\nThe plan already accounts for this with the \"check if still in progress\" logic. Does this clarify the approach? Should I proceed with implementation, or do you want to discuss the mapping logic further?"

Here's what was completed:\n\n### ✅ Implementation Complete\n\n1. **Updated RewriteLogEvent Types** (`src/git/rewrite_log.rs`)\n   - Replaced single `CherryPick` event with `CherryPickStart`, `CherryPickComplete`, and `CherryPickAbort`\n   - Added proper event structs with source/new commit tracking\n   - Updated tests to use new event types\n\n2. **Created Cherry-Pick Hooks** (`src/commands/hooks/cherry_pick_hooks.rs`)\n   - Pre-hook: Captures original HEAD and source commits, logs Start event\n   - Post-hook: Detects completion/abort, builds commit mappings, triggers authorship rewrite\n   - Handles conflicts with `--continue` and `--abort`\n   - Parses various cherry-pick formats (single, multiple, ranges like `A..C`)\n\n3. **Added Authorship Rewrite Logic** (`src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs`)\n   - New `rewrite_authorship_after_cherry_pick()` function\n   - Reuses existing infrastructure (`rewrite_single_commit_authorship`)\n   - Handles 1:1 mappings and empty commits gracefully\n\n4. **Wired Up Hooks** (`src/commands/git_handlers.rs`, `src/commands/hooks/mod.rs`)\n   - Integrated pre/post hooks into git command flow\n   - Registered cherry_pick_hooks module\n\n5. **Added Test Helpers** (`src/git/test_utils/mod.rs`)\n   - `cherry_pick()`: Basic cherry-pick operation\n   - `cherry_pick_with_conflicts()`: Test conflict scenarios\n   - `cherry_pick_continue()`: Continue after resolving conflicts\n   - `cherry_pick_abort()`: Abort operation\n\n6. **Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/cherry_pick.rs`)\n   - Single commit cherry-pick\n   - Multiple commits in sequence\n   - Cherry-pick with conflicts and --continue\n   - Cherry-pick --abort\n   - Cherry-pick without AI authorship\n   - Multiple AI sessions preservation\n   - Trees-identical fast path\n   - Empty commits handling\n\n7. **Updated Documentation** (`docs/limitations.mdx`)\n   - Changed cherry-pick support from ❌ to ✅\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Sequential handling**: Properly tracks A → A', B → B', C → C' transformations\n- **Conflict support**: Detects in-progress state via `.git/CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` and `.git/sequencer/`\n- **Reconstruction**: Uses hanging commit + blame approach (same as rebase)\n- **Fast path**: Copies authorship log when trees are identical\n- **Graceful degradation**: Handles missing authorship logs, empty commits, etc.\n\nThe implementation follows the proven rebase pattern and successfully preserves AI authorship attribution through cherry-pick operations!"

Here's what I fixed:\n\n## The Problem\n\nDuring cherry-pick with conflicts, when you partially resolved the conflict and committed, the authorship reconstruction tried to blame lines that didn't exist in the \"hanging commit\" (the temporary commit used for blame context). In your case, it tried to blame line 30 in a file that only had 26 lines.\n\n## The Root Cause\n\nWhen the code couldn't find an inserted line in the hanging commit, it used a fallback calculation: `new_line + (i as u32)`. This could produce line numbers beyond the file's actual bounds, especially after conflict resolution when the file structure differs from expectations.\n\n## The Fix\n\nI added two safety mechanisms in `src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs`:\n\n1. **Bounds checking**: Before trying to blame a line, verify it's within the hanging commit's line count\n2. **Graceful error handling**: If blame fails (e.g., file doesn't exist or line is out of bounds), log it and continue processing other lines instead of failing the entire operation\n\nNow when you cherry-pick with conflicts:\n- Lines that can't be mapped to the hanging commit are skipped with a debug message\n- Blame errors are caught and logged instead of crashing\n- The cherry-pick completes successfully, even if some lines can't have their authorship reconstructed\n\nThis is reasonable because if a line doesn't exist in the original commit's context (the hanging commit), we genuinely can't reconstruct its authorship history - it's a new line from the conflict resolution."

It's a genuinely new line, likely from conflict resolution or new changes in the cherry-picked commit. We should just skip it and move on.\n\nThis also fixes your original error cleanly: lines that can't be found in the hanging commit are simply skipped, so we never try to blame line 30 in a 26-line file."

Let me summarize what I've implemented to address your concern:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nYou were absolutely right that pathspec resets weren't being handled correctly. Here's what I fixed:\n\n### The Problem\nThe original code treated pathspec resets as a simple filtering operation, but didn't properly handle the case where files are reset to earlier versions with uncommitted changes on top. It was missing the 3-way merge/blame logic needed to assign authorship correctly.\n\n### The Solution\n\nI've restructured the reset handling to properly support pathspecs:\n\n1. **For `--hard` with pathspecs**: Now calls `handle_reset_hard_pathspec` which filters out working log entries for the affected files only.\n\n2. **For `--soft/--mixed/--merge` with pathspecs**: Now calls a new `handle_reset_pathspec_preserve_working_dir` function that:\n   - Backs up the existing working log for HEAD, filtering to keep only non-pathspec files\n   - Runs the full 3-way merge reconstruction logic (via `handle_reset_preserve_working_dir`) to properly assign blame for the pathspec files\n   - Filters the reconstructed working log to only include pathspec files\n   - Merges the two sets: non-pathspec files from before + pathspec files from the reconstruction\n   - Saves the merged working log for HEAD (which hasn't moved in a pathspec reset)\n   - Cleans up temporary working logs\n\nThis ensures that:\n- The 3-way merge/blame logic is applied to properly track AI authorship for files that were reset\n- Files not in the pathspec are preserved in the working log\n- Everything is stored correctly for HEAD (which doesn't move during pathspec resets)\n\nThe key insight you pointed out is that we needed to use the regular `handle_reset_preserve_working_dir` functionality and filter the results, rather than treating pathspec resets as a completely separate case. The implementation now does exactly that!"

          "text": "You're absolutely right! For `reset --hard` with pathspec, the files are being forcibly reset to match the target commit in both the index and working directory - all uncommitted changes are discarded.\n\nSo technically, we should be copying the authorship entries from `target_commit_sha` for those specific files. But as you say, there's a strong argument for keeping the simpler code path:\n\n**Arguments for the current simple approach:**\n- **Less code complexity**: Just filter out the pathspec files from the working log\n- **Trusted behavior**: Simpler logic is easier to reason about and less likely to have bugs\n- **Reasonable semantics**: Since --hard discards all changes, it's sensible to just remove those files from the working log entirely. When they're edited again, fresh authorship tracking will start.\n- **Avoids edge cases**: What if the target commit doesn't have an authorship log? Or what if the file didn't exist at that commit? The simple \"just remove it\" approach handles all these cleanly.\n\nThe more complex \"correct\" version would need to:\n1. Load authorship log from target_commit_sha\n2. Extract entries for pathspec files\n3. Convert them to working log checkpoints\n4. Merge with non-pathspec working log\n5. Handle edge cases (file not in target, no authorship log, etc.)\n\nGiven that `--hard` is explicitly about discarding work, the simple approach of removing those entries from the working log is perfectly reasonable. If someone does a `--hard` reset on a file, they're throwing away all uncommitted work anyway, so starting fresh with authorship tracking makes sense.\n\nI'd say let's keep the current simple implementation! It's cleaner and the behavior is perfectly acceptable for the `--hard` use case."

Here's what was done:\n\n### Implementation Changes (`src/commands/hooks/reset_hooks.rs`)\n\n1. **Removed invalid pathspec combinations**: Git doesn't allow `--soft` or `--hard` with pathspecs, so the code now only handles `--mixed` (or default) with pathspecs.\n\n2. **Created `handle_reset_pathspec_preserve_working_dir`**: This function properly handles pathspec resets by:\n   - Backing up existing working log entries for non-pathspec files\n   - Running the full 3-way merge reconstruction logic (via `handle_reset_preserve_working_dir`) to properly assign blame for the pathspec files\n   - Filtering the reconstructed working log to only include pathspec files\n   - Merging the two sets: non-pathspec files from before + pathspec files from the reconstruction\n   - Saving the merged working log for HEAD (which doesn't move during pathspec resets)\n\n3. **Key insight**: The implementation uses the regular `handle_reset_preserve_working_dir` functionality and filters the results, which ensures AI authorship is properly carried forward from earlier authorship logs without losing attribution.\n\n### Test Coverage (`tests/reset.rs`)\n\nAdded comprehensive tests for pathspec resets:\n\n1. **`test_reset_mixed_pathspec_preserves_ai_authorship`**: Tests that when resetting one file with pathspec while having uncommitted changes on another file, both are handled correctly:\n   - Pathspec file is reconstructed with AI authorship\n   - Non-pathspec file preserves uncommitted changes\n\n2. **`test_reset_mixed_pathspec_multiple_commits`**: Tests that pathspec resets work correctly across multiple commits with AI changes, properly preserving uncommitted changes for non-pathspec files.\n\nAll 14 reset tests pass, and the pathspec reset functionality now correctly carries AI authorship forward from earlier authorship logs to the new working log, ensuring no attribution is lost."
