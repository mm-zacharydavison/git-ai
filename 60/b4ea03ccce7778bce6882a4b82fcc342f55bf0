          "text": "Excellent! The Timer has been successfully refactored. Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## New Timer API\n\nThe Timer now provides the clean DX you requested:\n\n```rust\n// Start a timer and get a callable closure\nlet end = Timer::default().start(\"pre-command hooks\");\n\n// Later, call end() to print the duration\nend(); // Prints: \"[timer] pre-command hooks took 123.45ms\"\n\n// Or capture the duration for further use\nlet duration = end();\n// Still prints the message AND returns a Duration you can use\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Simplified struct** - Removed the `HashMap` since we no longer need to track multiple timers\n2. **Returns a closure** - `start()` now returns `impl FnOnce() -> Duration`\n3. **Dual purpose** - Calling the returned closure both prints the timing info AND returns a `Duration`\n4. **Cleaner API** - No need to manage timer keys or mutable state\n\nThe closure captures:\n- The start `Instant`\n- The `enabled` flag (respects debug mode and `GIT_AI_TIMER` env var)\n- The label string\n\nThis gives you maximum flexibility - you can just call `end()` for the side effect of printing, or capture the duration for additional processing!",

        {

          "text": "cool also add start_quiet \n\nwhen those end it doesn't automatically log, just put duration in the result of the clojure",
          "timestamp": "2025-10-13T19:24:46.211Z"
        },
        {
          "type": "assistant",
          "text": "Perfect! I've added `start_quiet` to the Timer API. Now you have both options:\n\n```rust\n// Regular start - prints automatically\nlet end = Timer::default().start(\"pre-command hooks\");\nend(); // Prints: \"[timer] pre-command hooks took 123.45ms\"\n\n// Quiet start - no automatic logging\nlet end = Timer::default().start_quiet(\"background task\");\nlet duration = end(); // Just returns Duration, no printing\n```\n\nThe `start_quiet` method is simpler since it doesn't need to track the `enabled` flag or label - it just captures the start time and returns the elapsed duration when called. This gives you full control over when and how you want to log timing information!",
