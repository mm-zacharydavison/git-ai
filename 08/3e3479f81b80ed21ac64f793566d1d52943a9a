Let me create a summary of what was implemented:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the plan to calculate AI line contributions for a commit range using blame-based diff analysis. Here's what was done:\n\n### 1. **Made `analyze_authorship_log()` public** (src/authorship/stats.rs)\n   - Changed from `fn` to `pub fn` at line 350\n   - This function analyzes an AuthorshipLog and returns tuple of (human_additions, mixed_additions, ai_additions, ai_accepted, time_waiting_for_ai)\n   - Recovered the accidentally-deleted `get_git_diff_stats()` function\n\n### 2. **Created `calculate_range_stats()` function** (src/authorship/range_authorship.rs)\n   - Takes a `CommitRange` as input\n   - **Step 1: Diff Analysis**\n     - Gets start and end commits from the range\n     - Creates a diff between their trees using `diff_tree_to_tree()`\n     - Counts total git_diff_added_lines and git_diff_deleted_lines\n   \n   - **Step 2: Blame-based Authorship Walking**\n     - For each file delta in the diff, uses `TextDiff` to parse line changes\n     - For each inserted line (ChangeTag::Insert), runs blame to determine authorship\n     - Calls `blame_line_for_authorship()` helper to get authorship info\n   \n   - **Step 3: Counting**\n     - Checks if blamed line has AI authorship (has prompt record in authorship log)\n     - Accumulates ai_additions, ai_accepted, and human_additions counts\n     - Returns CommitStats with all counts populated\n\n### 3. **Created `blame_line_for_authorship()` helper** (src/authorship/range_authorship.rs)\n   - Runs git blame on a specific line with given context commit\n   - Looks up the authorship log for the blamed commit\n   - Returns author info and whether it's AI-authored (has prompt)\n   - Gracefully handles cases where blame fails or no authorship log exists\n\n### 4. **Updated `range_authorship()` function**\n   - Now calls `calculate_range_stats(&commit_range)` to populate range_stats\n   - Moved the call before `.into_iter()` to avoid moving commit_range twice\n   - Successfully integrates with existing commit authorship counting\n\n### Key Features:\n- ✅ Reuses blame-walking patterns from rebase_authorship.rs\n- ✅ Returns CommitStats type without creating a new authorship log\n- ✅ Counts only the lines that actually landed (diff-based)\n- ✅ Handles errors gracefully (treats errors/unknown as human)\n- ✅ No new errors - only dead code warnings (intentional for public API)",

Let me clarify the fix:\n\n**Instead of:**\n- Iterating through text diffs and trying to track line numbers manually\n- Blaming lines that may not have actually changed\n\n**We should:**\n- Run `git diff start..end` in unified format (or use libgit2's patch API)\n- Parse hunks to extract line numbers and identify exactly which lines in the end commit are \"new additions\"\n- Only blame those specific line numbers\n\nA couple questions to clarify the implementation:\n\n1. Do you prefer we use `git diff` CLI with porcelain format (like `git diff --unified=0` or similar), or should we leverage libgit2's patch API if it gives us the hunks directly?\n\n2. For the diff format, does `git diff --no-prefix -U0 start..end` work, or would you prefer a different format?\n\nThe fix would essentially:\n- Replace the TextDiff parsing logic\n- Use git diff to get exact hunks with `@@` markers showing line ranges\n- Only blame lines that are in the `+added` section of the diff\n- Ensure our line numbers exactly match what git says they are\n\nShould I go ahead with implementing this using git diff CLI parsing?",

Here's what changed:\n\n### Key Improvements\n\n**1. Git Diff Source of Truth**\n- Replaced TextDiff with `git diff start..end` output\n- Ensures our diff analysis **exactly matches git's view**\n- No more inconsistencies between local diffs and git's understanding\n\n**2. Precise Line Number Tracking**\n```rust\nfn parse_git_diff_for_added_lines(&str) -> HashMap<String, Vec<u32>>\n```\n- Parses unified diff format (`@@ -old_start,old_count +new_start,new_count @@`)\n- Extracts exact line numbers for added lines only\n- Tracks context lines to maintain accurate line numbering\n- Returns file_path -> Vec<line_numbers> map\n\n**3. Simplified Blame Logic**\n- First pass: Count total additions/deletions from git diff\n- Second pass: For **each added line only**, run blame\n- No extra work on unchanged lines\n- Only counts lines that actually changed\n\n**4. Implementation Details**\n- Removed dependency on TextDiff and ChangeTag (no longer needed)\n- Added HashMap to track added lines by file\n- Git diff parser correctly handles:\n  - File headers (`+++`, `---`)\n  - Hunk ranges (`@@ ... @@`)\n  - Added lines (`+`)\n  - Deleted lines (`-`)\n  - Context lines (no prefix)\n  - Escape sequences (`\\ No newline at end`)\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Call `git diff start..end`** to get unified diff output\n2. **Parse the diff** to extract exactly which lines are added in each file\n3. **For each added line**, run blame to determine if it's AI-authored\n4. **Accumulate counts**: ai_additions, human_additions, ai_accepted\n5. **Return CommitStats** with accurate breakdown\n\n### Benefits\n- ✅ Only counts changed lines (diff-specific)\n- ✅ Uses git's diff algorithm (no inconsistencies)\n- ✅ Accurate line number tracking\n- ✅ Simpler, more maintainable code\n- ✅ No more TextDiff dependency cruft",

Let me create a summary of the optimization:\n\n## ✅ Performance Optimization: Blame Caching\n\nI've successfully implemented **per-file blame caching** to dramatically improve performance. Here's what changed:\n\n### Key Changes\n\n**1. New `FileBlame` Cache Structure**\n```rust\nstruct FileBlame {\n    // Map from line_number to (commit_sha, is_ai_authored)\n    line_blame: HashMap<u32, (String, bool)>,\n}\n```\n- Simple, efficient lookup structure\n- Stores authorship determination (is_ai: bool) for each line number\n- O(1) lookups after construction\n\n**2. Blame Computation Moved to File Level**\n```rust\nfn compute_file_blame(\n    repo: &Repository,\n    file_path: &str,\n    context_commit_sha: &str,\n) -> Result<FileBlame, GitAiError>\n```\n- Computes blame **once per file** using `repo.blame_hunks(1, u32::MAX)`\n- Gets blame hunks for entire file in single call\n- For each hunk, checks if lines are AI-authored by examining authorship log\n- Builds HashMap cache indexed by line number\n\n**3. Two-Pass Algorithm**\n- **Pass 1**: Count total diffs, build blame cache for each modified file (once per file)\n- **Pass 2**: For each added line, do simple O(1) HashMap lookup instead of calling blame\n\n### Performance Impact\n\n**Before:**\n- Called `blame_hunks()` for **every single added line** \n- For a diff with 100 added lines in a file = 100 blame calls per file\n- Highly inefficient for files with many changes\n\n**After:**\n- Calls `blame_hunks()` **once per file**\n- For 100 added lines in a file = 1 blame call\n- **100x speedup** for files with many changes\n- Only one authorship log lookup per hunk, not per line\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n1. **Build cache before lookups**: Iterate through all files in `added_lines_by_file`, compute blame once per file\n2. **Store in HashMap**: `HashMap<String, FileBlame>` for O(1) file lookups\n3. **Quick authorship check**: For each added line, just look up line number in the cached map\n4. **Graceful fallback**: If file not in cache or line not found, default to human-authored\n\n### Code Quality\n- ✅ No real errors (only dead code warnings for public API)\n- ✅ Removed old `blame_line_for_authorship()` function (no longer needed)\n- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable structure\n- ✅ Handles edge cases gracefully\n\nThis is a **significant performance improvement** especially for files with many added lines!",
