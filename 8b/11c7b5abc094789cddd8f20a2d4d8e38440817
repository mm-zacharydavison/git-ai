Here's what I fixed for your x86 builds:\n\n## The Problems:\n\n1. **macOS Intel build was creating an ARM binary** \n   - It was running on `macos-latest` (Apple Silicon M1/M2)\n   - Building without `--target` flag meant it built for native arch (ARM)\n   - Naming this ARM binary as `git-ai-macos-x64` - completely wrong!\n\n2. **Cache pollution**\n   - The cache included the `target` directory, which could mix up binaries between builds\n\n3. **Silent failures**\n   - `continue-on-error: true` meant failed builds continued silently\n   - This could cause empty/wrong artifacts to be uploaded\n\n4. **No verification**\n   - No checks to verify the binaries were actually built for the right architecture\n\n5. **Invalid ARM Linux runner**\n   - `ubuntu-22.04-arm` doesn't exist as a GitHub runner\n\n## What I Fixed:\n\nâœ… **macOS Intel build now:**\n   - Uses `macos-13` (last Intel runner)\n   - Explicitly builds with `--target x86_64-apple-darwin`\n   - Verifies architecture with `file` and `lipo -info`\n\nâœ… **Removed cache pollution:**\n   - Removed `target` directory from cache (only caches cargo registry/git now)\n\nâœ… **Added verification steps:**\n   - Linux: uses `file` and `ldd` to verify ELF format\n   - Windows: uses `file` to verify PE format\n   - macOS Intel: uses `file` and `lipo` to verify Mach-O x86_64\n\nâœ… **Removed `continue-on-error`:**\n   - Builds now fail loudly if something goes wrong\n   - Release job only runs if builds succeed (`success()` instead of `always()`)\n\nâœ… **Disabled ARM Linux build:**\n   - Commented out the invalid `ubuntu-22.04-arm` entry\n\nNow your Linux x86 binary should be an actual Linux binary, not a macOS one with Rosetta errors! ðŸŽ‰",

Ubuntu 20.04 builds will work on most systems from 2020 onwards, which is a good balance between compatibility and ease of setup.\n\nThe `rusqlite = { version = \"0.31\", features = [\"bundled\"] }` in your Cargo.toml is actually already doing the right thing - it's bundling SQLite so you don't have external dependencies there.

          "text": "Excellent! Here's what I've set up using Docker:\n\n## What Changed:\n\n**Linux builds now use Docker containers** running Ubuntu 20.04 (which has GLIBC 2.31):\n\n1. **Runs on `ubuntu-22.04`** GitHub runners but builds **inside** an `ubuntu:20.04` Docker container\n2. **Both x64 and ARM64 Linux** builds use this approach\n3. The Docker container:\n   - Installs Rust and build tools fresh\n   - Builds your binary with older GLIBC linkage\n   - Strips the binary\n   - Outputs to the mounted workspace\n\n4. **Non-Linux builds** (Windows, macOS) continue using the normal workflow without Docker\n\n5. **Added verification** that shows the required GLIBC version using `objdump`\n\n## Benefits:\n\nâœ… **Wider compatibility** - Built against GLIBC 2.31 instead of 2.34+  \nâœ… **Works on GitHub Actions** - Uses ubuntu-22.04 runners with Docker  \nâœ… **No external dependencies** - Everything runs in GitHub's infrastructure  \nâœ… **Transparent** - Verification steps show exactly what GLIBC version is required\n\nYour Linux binaries will now work on any system with GLIBC 2.31+ (Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11, CentOS 8, etc.) instead of requiring GLIBC 2.34+!",
