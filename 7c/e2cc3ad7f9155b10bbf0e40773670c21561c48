I've cleaned up the documentation with several improvements to make it clearer and more professional for developers:\n\n## Key improvements made:\n\n1. **Grammar and spelling fixes**: Fixed \"became\" → \"become\", \"equivilant\" → \"equivalent\", \"psuedo\" → \"pseudo\", \"immediatly\" → \"immediately\", etc.\n\n2. **Better structure and formatting**:\n   - Added bold formatting for key terms like \"Hooks\" and \"Direct Integration\"\n   - Improved bullet point formatting with consistent capitalization\n   - Better code block formatting and syntax highlighting\n\n3. **Clearer language**:\n   - \"Your Agent\" → \"Your agent\" (consistent capitalization)\n   - \"it is easy\" → \"integrating Git AI is straightforward\"\n   - \"non-trivial amount\" → \"significant\"\n   - \"probably the best path\" → \"the recommended integration path\"\n\n4. **Improved readability**:\n   - Better sentence structure and flow\n   - More concise explanations\n   - Clearer step-by-step instructions\n   - Better formatting for the checklist section\n\n5. **Professional tone**:\n   - More consistent terminology\n   - Better technical precision\n   - Clearer explanations of complex concepts\n\nThe documentation now reads much more professionally and should be easier for developers to follow when integrating their agents with Git AI."
