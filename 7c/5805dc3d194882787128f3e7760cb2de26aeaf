The refactoring maintains the same functionality while providing cleaner, more specific event types for each stash operation."

          "text": "Great! I've reviewed the code. Let me think through how `git stash` and `git stash pop` work and whether we can support them:\n\n## Understanding the Challenge\n\n**Key insight from the code:**\n- **Working logs** (AI authorship for uncommitted changes) are stored in `.git-ai/working_logs/<commit_sha>/`\n- They contain checkpoints with AI session info, file changes, and line ranges\n- Reset support (lines 1313-1430 in rebase_authorship.rs) shows how to reconstruct working logs when HEAD changes\n\n**How git stash works:**\n1. `git stash push` - Saves working directory + index changes, creates special commits in `.git/refs/stash`\n2. `git stash pop` - Applies most recent stash, may have conflicts\n\n## The Core Problem\n\nWhen you stash on commit A and pop on commit B:\n- Working log exists for commit A (keyed by A's SHA)  \n- After pop, working directory is based on commit B\n- The working log for A still exists but isn't connected to current work\n- We need to either reconstruct it for commit B, or find a way to preserve the reference\n\n## Questions Before Planning\n\nI need to clarify the scope and expected behavior:\n\n1. **Cross-commit support priority?**\n   - a) Simple case only: stash/pop on same HEAD (working log persists automatically, no code needed)\n   - b) Full support: stash on commit A, switch branches, pop on commit B (requires reconstruction like reset does)\n\n2. **Conflict handling?**\n   - a) Only support clean stash pop (no conflicts)\n   - b) Support conflicts with continue/abort pattern (like cherry-pick/rebase)\n\n3. **Stash operations to support?**\n   - a) Just `stash` and `stash pop` (most common, ~80% of usage)\n   - b) Full stash stack: `stash list`, `stash apply`, `stash@{n}`, etc."

          "text": "Great question! Let me trace through the cross-commit scenario to verify the plan works correctly:\n\n## Scenario: Stash on Commit A, Pop on Commit B\n\n**Initial state on Commit A:**\n- File has 100 lines\n- Lines 50-55 are AI-authored (in working log for A)\n- You stash these changes\n\n**Switch to Commit B (different branch):**\n- Same file now has 120 lines (refactored, different content)\n- No knowledge of the stashed AI authorship\n\n**Pop stash on Commit B:**\n\n### The Critical Mechanism\n\nThe plan works because of this key function call in step 4:\n\n```rust\ncreate_authorship_log_for_hanging_commit(\n    repo,\n    original_commit_sha,  // Commit A\n    &hanging_commit_sha.to_string(),\n    human_author,\n)?;\n```\n\nLooking at this function (lines 1479-1565 in rebase_authorship.rs), it does:\n\n1. **Gets authorship log from commit A** (committed AI changes)\n2. **Gets working log from commit A** (uncommitted AI changes - the stashed content!)\n3. **Applies working log checkpoints to the authorship log** (lines 1526-1540)\n4. **Attaches the COMBINED result to hanging commit**\n\nSo the hanging commit has the **complete AI authorship state** from commit A (committed + uncommitted).\n\n### The Blame Step\n\nThen when we blame (step 5):\n1. Diff working dir vs commit B to find inserted lines (e.g., line 80 in new coordinates)\n2. Find same line content in hanging commit (might be line 55 in old coordinates)\n3. Blame that line in hanging commit context → traces to AI authorship from A\n\n**The content matching** (not line number matching) is what makes cross-commit work! \n\nLines 939-951 in rebase_authorship.rs:\n```rust\nfor (i, inserted_line) in inserted.iter().enumerate() {\n    // Find a matching line number in hanging content, prefer the first not yet used\n    let mut matched_hanging_line: Option<u32> = None;\n    for (idx, h_line) in hanging_lines.iter().enumerate() {\n        if h_line == inserted_line {  // ← CONTENT MATCH, not line number\n            let candidate = (idx as u32) + 1;\n            if !used_hanging_line_numbers.contains(&candidate) {\n                matched_hanging_line = Some(candidate);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Yes, the plan works for cross-commit stash pop!** The reconstruction uses content-based matching, not line-number mapping, which handles file changes between commits.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with implementing this plan, or would you like any clarifications first?"

Let me create a summary of the implementation:\n\n## ✅ Implementation Complete: Stash Pop/Apply Authorship Support\n\nI've successfully implemented full stash authorship support following the plan. Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### Files Modified\n\n1. **src/git/rewrite_log.rs** - Updated `StashEvent` struct with `original_head` and `target_head` fields\n2. **src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs** - Added `reconstruct_working_log_after_stash_apply()` function (~125 lines)\n3. **src/commands/git_handlers.rs** - Wired up stash pre/post hooks\n4. **src/commands/hooks/mod.rs** - Registered stash_hooks module\n\n### Files Created\n\n1. **src/commands/hooks/stash_hooks.rs** - Complete hooks implementation (~330 lines)\n   - `pre_stash_hook()` - Captures state before stash operations\n   - `post_stash_hook()` - Handles authorship reconstruction after pop/apply\n   - Helper functions for stash ref parsing, conflict detection, etc.\n\n2. **tests/stash.rs** - Comprehensive test suite (8 tests, all passing):\n   - ✅ Simple stash/pop on same commit\n   - ✅ Stash on A, pop on B (cross-commit)\n   - ✅ Stash pop after branch switch (cross-branch)\n   - ✅ Stash apply (vs pop)\n   - ✅ Stash with no AI authorship\n   - ✅ Stash with multiple AI sessions\n   - ✅ Stash on dirty repo (appends to existing working log)\n   - ✅ Empty stash handling\n\n3. **Test helpers** - Added to `src/git/test_utils/mod.rs`:\n   - `stash_push()` - Stash current changes\n   - `stash_pop()` - Pop with conflict detection\n   - `stash_apply()` - Apply specific stash with conflict detection\n\n### Key Features\n\n✅ **Cross-commit reconstruction**: Stash on commit A, pop on commit B preserves AI authorship using content-based blame matching\n\n✅ **Conflict handling**: Gracefully skips conflicted files during reconstruction (like checkpoint.rs pattern)\n\n✅ **Working log preservation**: Automatically preserved when stash/pop on same commit, reconstructed when crossing commits\n\n✅ **Append behavior**: When popping onto dirty working directory, appends rather than replaces existing checkpoints\n\n✅ **Multiple stashes**: Each stash independently preserves its authorship state\n\n### Test Results\n\n```\nrunning 8 tests\ntest test_empty_stash ... ok\ntest test_simple_stash_pop_same_commit ... ok\ntest test_stash_apply_preserves_stash ... ok\ntest test_stash_pop_cross_branch ... ok\ntest test_stash_no_ai_authorship ... ok\ntest test_stash_on_a_pop_on_b ... ok\ntest test_stash_multiple_ai_sessions ... ok\ntest test_stash_on_dirty_repo_appends ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 8 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored\n```\n\nAll existing tests continue to pass (cherry-pick, reset, simple_additions, etc.).\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe implementation uses the proven \"hanging commit + blame\" pattern from reset:\n\n1. When stash is popped/applied, capture current working directory as tree\n2. Create temporary commit with working tree + current HEAD as parent\n3. Create hanging commit with working tree + stash's original HEAD as parent\n4. Attach authorship log (committed + working log) from original HEAD to hanging commit\n5. Run blame-based reconstruction comparing working dir vs current HEAD in hanging commit context\n6. Content-based line matching (not line numbers) handles cross-commit file changes\n7. Convert to checkpoints and append to current HEAD's working log\n8. Clean up temporary commits\n\nThe stash authorship support is now fully functional and ready for use! 🎉"
