Now we need to migrate the remaining test files to use the same patterns.\nNew Testing API Overview\nImport structure:\nKey fixtures:\nTestRepo - Represents a git repository\nTestFile - Represents a file with expected authorship\nFluent file API:\nfile.set_contents(lines![...]) - Set initial file contents (handles AI/human attribution automatically via checkpoints)\nfile.insert_at(index, lines![...]) - Insert lines at position\nfile.replace_at(index, line) - Replace single line\nfile.delete_at(index) - Delete single line\nfile.delete_range(start, end) - Delete range [start..end)\nfile.stage() - Stage just this file\nfile.assert_lines_and_blame(lines![...]) - Main assertion for fully committed files\nfile.assert_committed_lines(lines![...]) - For partial staging tests (filters uncommitted lines)\nFluent repo API:\nrepo.filename(\"path.txt\") - Create/get a TestFile\nrepo.stage_all_and_commit(\"message\") - Stage all + commit (returns NewCommit)\nrepo.commit(\"message\") - Commit staged only (returns NewCommit)\nrepo.git(&[\"arg1\", \"arg2\"]) - Run git commands directly for edge cases\nrepo.git_ai(&[\"arg1\", \"arg2\"]) - Run git-ai commands directly\nLine macro:\nMigration Guidelines\nAll tests should be end-to-end - Use repo.git() and repo.git_ai() commands, let hooks handle authorship tracking\nKeep all test cases - Don't remove tests, just adapt them to the new API\nUse fluent assertions - Every test should end with assert_lines_and_blame() or assert_committed_lines()\nReduce snapshot dependency - Only use snapshots where necessary; prefer explicit assertions with the fluent API\nPartial staging pattern:\nRemove old imports - Delete unused imports like TmpRepo, LineRange (unless actually used), assert_debug_snapshot (unless keeping snapshots)\nExample Migration\nBefore (old TmpRepo API):\nAfter (new fluent API):\nSuccess Criteria\n[ ] All tests compile and pass\n[ ] No remaining TmpRepo references\n[ ] Every test ends with an assertion (usually assert_lines_and_blame or assert_committed_lines)\n[ ] Code is more readable - the test intent should be clear from the fluent API\n[ ] Partial staging tests use file.stage() + assert_committed_lines()\n[ ] No unused imports warnings\nTips\nStart simple: Migrate basic tests first to get familiar with the API\nFor complex operations (cherry-pick, rebase, reset): Use repo.git(&[\"command\", \"args\"]) for the git operations, then assert with the fluent API\nWhen stuck: Look at tests/simple_additions.rs for patterns\nAsk for help: If you need new helper methods in TestFile or TestRepo, ask!\n\n@test_repo.rs @test_file.rs \n\nExample @simple_additions.rs",

Here's a summary of the changes:\n\n## Bug Fix Summary\n\n### Problem\nThe rebase commit mapping logic had a critical flaw when handling squashed commits (N→M where N > M):\n1. **Line 531-541 in `git_handlers.rs`**: Only passed the last original commit when detecting squashing, discarding authorship from all other commits\n2. **Line 325 in `rebase_authorship.rs`**: Used simple `zip()` which couldn't handle many-to-few mappings\n\n### Solution\n\n**1. Fixed `build_rebase_commit_mappings` in `git_handlers.rs` (lines 531-533)**\n- Removed the lossy special case that kept only the last commit\n- Now passes ALL commits through to the authorship rewriting logic\n- Simplified the code to let the authorship layer handle different mapping scenarios\n\n**2. Enhanced `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase` in `rebase_authorship.rs` (lines 322-383)**\n- Added detection for many-to-few mappings (`original_commits.len() > new_commits.len()`)\n- Created new `handle_squashed_rebase()` function to properly reconstruct authorship when commits are squashed\n- For squashed commits, uses the head of original commits (which contains all accumulated changes) to reconstruct authorship for each new commit\n- Maintains the existing 1:1 mapping logic for normal rebases\n\n### Result\n- ✅ Authorship information from all original commits is now preserved during squashing\n- ✅ Handles N→1 squashing (multiple commits to one)\n- ✅ Handles N→M squashing (multiple commits to fewer commits)\n- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with 1:1 rebases\n- ✅ Code compiles successfully with no new warnings\n\nThe fix ensures that when performing interactive rebases with squashing, the authorship reconstruction will use the complete history from all original commits rather than losing information from all but the last commit."

Creates 3 AI commits with different files and authorship\n2. Performs an interactive rebase that squashes all 3 commits into 1\n3. Calls `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase` with 3 original → 1 new commit mapping\n4. Verifies that:\n   - The squashed commit has an authorship log\n   - All 3 files from the original commits exist\n   - Authorship attribution is preserved\n\n### Bug Fixes Applied\n\n1. **`git_handlers.rs`**: Removed the lossy logic that kept only the last commit during squashing\n2. **`rebase_authorship.rs`**: \n   - Added proper many-to-few detection and handling\n   - Used comprehensive squash reconstruction logic that traces through all original commits\n   - Added few-to-many handling for commit splitting\n   - Fixed `base_commit_sha` not being set in `rewrite_authorship_after_squash_or_rebase`\n\n### Result\n✅ All 9 rebase tests pass, including the new squashing test  \n✅ Full test suite passes (119 tests total)  \n✅ Authorship from all commits is now preserved during squashing operations"

Should the struct need access to Repository to run blame operations?\n   - a) Yes, store a reference/clone of Repository in the struct\n   - b) No, pass Repository as parameter to methods that need it\n   - c) Take pre-computed blame results as input\n\n5.

The file path lookups are the bottleneck, not the data structure choice.\n\nIf you want sorted iteration, you could always call `.keys().collect::<Vec<_>>().sort()` when needed, rather than paying the O(log n) cost on every lookup.",

In a merge scenario you'd probably use\ngit diff --name-only <commit> <commit>\nto figure out what's in scope.\nAs it builds the struct it does a blame on each file in parallel and builds the attributions.\n--- that lets us get pairs for the ops we care about\nFor squash operations\nbase HEAD\nHEAD of feature branch\nFor reset we'd have\nHEAD + working log\nreset target\nRebase it's\nHEAD (dirty heads will be blocked by git so safe to assume clean) --> we'll compute pre-commit and save it to file system. We can resolve the list of all the commits being considered in pre-rebase hook and use the union of their pathspecs to build it.\nnew HEAD (using same union). we might drop any AI conflict resolutions but who cares...\nCherrypick it's\ncommit we're targeting plus pathspecs\nHEAD + working log\n---- and then we need some merge code\nI'm still fuzzy on it, but it feels like you give it to the final form of the file (always known), it each lineage computes its diff to that version and adjusts its authorship\nThen we have two separate attestations for the same file. WE favor one lineage when merging, and if there's a gap either of them can fill it\n2:00\nIf that's right, roughly speaking then the rewrite code for everything looks like\nlet a = VirtualAttestations::from_repo_state(pathspecs)\nlet b = VirtualAttestations::from_commit(pathspecs)\n\n// often A, but sometimes not if there was a conflict resolved. we might even be able to have this be a method of a\nlet final_state = get_final_state_for_pathspec(pathspecs)\n\nlet attestation = merge_attestations_favoring_first(a, b, final_state)\n\n// use this for rebase, ammend, merge --squash\nattestation.to_authorship_log()\n// use this for cherry picks or reset --softs\nattestation.to_initial_working_log_state()\n\n\nlet's build all the pieces, including the merge_attestations_favoring_first.

Here's a summary of what was added:\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\n### ✅ Step 1: File Content Storage\nAdded `file_contents: HashMap<String, String>` to `VirtualAttributions` struct and updated `compute_attributions_for_file` to return and store file contents.\n\n### ✅ Step 2: `from_repo_state` Constructor\nImplemented async constructor that:\n- Loads HEAD's authorship log\n- Reads and applies working log checkpoints\n- Reads file contents from working directory\n- Converts authorship log entries to line/char attributions\n\n### ✅ Step 3: `from_commit` Alias\nAdded simple wrapper that calls `new_for_base_commit` for clarity.\n\n### ✅ Step 4: `merge_attributions_favoring_first`\nCore merge function that:\n- Takes two `VirtualAttributions` and a `final_state` HashMap\n- Transforms both to final content using diffs\n- Merges with primary winning overlaps, secondary filling gaps\n- Returns new merged `VirtualAttributions`\n\n### ✅ Step 5: `transform_attributions_to_final`\nHelper using `AttributionTracker::update_attributions` to transform attributions from old content to new content via diffs, filtering out new insertions.\n\n### ✅ Step 6: `merge_char_attributions`\nCharacter-level merge logic that:\n- Creates coverage map for primary attributions\n- Adds all primary attributions\n- Adds secondary attributions only in uncovered ranges\n- Returns sorted, merged attributions\n\n### ✅ Step 7: Line Attribution Conversion\nUses existing `attributions_to_line_attributions` to derive line-level from merged char-level.\n\n### ✅ Step 8: `to_authorship_log` Method\nConverts `VirtualAttributions` to `AuthorshipLog` by:\n- Grouping line attributions by author\n- Creating line ranges (Single/Range)\n- Building attestation entries\n- Returning complete authorship log\n\n### ✅ Step 9: `to_initial_working_log_state` Stub\nAdded with `todo!()` as requested for future checkpoint work.\n\n### ✅ Step 10: Helper Methods\nAdded `get_file_content(&self, path: &str) -> Option<&String>`.\n\n## Usage Pattern\n```rust\nlet a = VirtualAttributions::from_repo_state(repo, head_sha, pathspecs).await?;\nlet b = VirtualAttributions::from_commit(repo, commit_sha, pathspecs).await?;\nlet final_state = get_final_state(pathspecs); // HashMap<String, String>\nlet merged = merge_attributions_favoring_first(a, b, final_state)?;\nlet log = merged.to_authorship_log()?; // For rebase, amend, merge --squash\n```\n\nThe code compiles successfully with only expected \"unused\" warnings since it's not yet integrated.

The pattern is now:\n\n```rust\n// Before (required passing head_sha):\nlet a = VirtualAttributions::from_repo_state(repo, head_sha, pathspecs).await?;\n\n// After (automatically gets HEAD):\nlet a = VirtualAttributions::from_repo_state(repo, pathspecs).await?;\n```\n\nThis is much cleaner and follows the principle of using the repository's built-in helpers rather than requiring external callers to manage Git references manually.",

But our new approach is trying to read the HEAD's authorship log first, which doesn't exist.\n\nLet me fix this by modifying the `from_repo_state` method to handle the case where HEAD has no authorship log:",

The checkpoint application happens in `from_working_log_for_commit`, but then we're throwing away that authorship log and creating a new one in `to_authorship_log()`.\n\nThe issue is that our VirtualAttributions doesn't store the authorship log - it only stores the line attributions. But the authorship log also needs the prompt records, which come from the checkpoint application.\n\nLet me fix this by modifying the VirtualAttributions to store the authorship log, or by changing the approach.

Now I can explain how the `human_author` parameter is used:\n\n## How `human_author` is Used\n\nThe `human_author` parameter is used to properly attribute AI-generated content to the human who initiated the AI session. Here's how it works:\n\n### 1. **Prompt Record Creation**\nWhen applying checkpoints, the system creates `PromptRecord` entries in the authorship log's metadata. The `human_author` parameter is used to set the `human_author` field in these records:\n\n```rust\nlet entry = self.metadata\n    .prompts\n    .entry(session_id.clone())\n    .or_insert(PromptRecord {\n        agent_id: agent.clone(),\n        human_author: human_author.map(|s| s.to_string()), // ← Used here\n        messages: transcript.messages().to_vec(),\n        total_additions: 0,\n        total_deletions: 0,\n        accepted_lines: 0,\n        overriden_lines: 0,\n    });\n```\n\n### 2. **Why This Matters**\nThe `human_author` field tracks who was responsible for initiating the AI session. This is important for:\n\n- **Accountability**: Knowing which human user requested the AI assistance\n- **Audit trails**: Tracking who authorized AI-generated changes\n- **Attribution**: Properly crediting both the AI agent and the human who used it\n\n### 3. **In the Amend Context**\nIn our commit amend implementation, we pass the actual human author from the commit:\n\n```rust\nVirtualAttributions::from_working_log_for_commit(\n    repo_clone,\n    original_commit.to_string(),\n    &pathspecs,\n    Some(_human_author.clone()), // ← Pass the actual human author\n)\n```\n\nThis ensures that when we apply checkpoints during an amend, the resulting authorship log correctly shows:\n- **AI agent**: The AI that generated the code (e.g., \"cursor\", \"gpt-4\")\n- **Human author**: The actual person who made the commit (e.g., \"Test User <test@example.com>\")\n\n### 4. **Test Verification**\nThis is why our test was failing initially - it expected:\n```rust\nhuman_author: Some(\"Test User <test@example.com>\")\n```\n\nBut we were getting:\n```rust\nhuman_author: Some(\"human\")  // From CheckpointKind::Human.to_str()\n```\n\nBy passing the actual human author parameter, we now get the correct attribution in the final authorship log.\n\nThe `human_author` parameter essentially bridges the gap between the technical checkpoint system (which uses generic identifiers) and the human-readable authorship tracking that users expect to see.",

It's about **tracking who initiated the AI session** for audit/accountability purposes.\n\nHere's what actually happens:\n\n## Content Attribution (Lines/Characters)\n- **AI-generated lines**: Still attributed to the AI agent (e.g., \"976aa32\" for cursor/gpt-4)\n- **Human-written lines**: Still attributed to \"human\" \n- **Mixed lines**: Split between AI and human based on who wrote each part\n\n## Human Author Field (Metadata)\nThe `human_author` parameter only affects the **metadata** in the `PromptRecord`:\n\n```rust\nPromptRecord {\n    agent_id: agent.clone(),           // AI agent info\n    human_author: human_author.map(|s| s.to_string()), // ← Only this field\n    messages: transcript.messages().to_vec(),\n    // ... other fields\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nIn our test, the final authorship log shows:\n\n```rust\n// Line attributions (content)\nline_ranges: [Range(6, 7)]  // Lines 6-7 attributed to AI agent \"976aa32\"\n\n// Prompt metadata (session info)  \nprompts: {\n    \"976aa32\": PromptRecord {\n        agent_id: AgentId { tool: \"cursor\", id: \"ai_agent\", model: \"gpt-4\" },\n        human_author: Some(\"Test User <test@example.com>\"), // ← Who initiated the AI session\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe `human_author` field answers: **\"Who was responsible for this AI session?\"**\n\n- **Lines 6-7**: Written by AI agent \"976aa32\" \n- **Session responsibility**: \"Test User <test@example.com>\" initiated the AI session\n\nThis is important for:\n- **Audit trails**: Knowing which human authorized AI changes\n- **Accountability**: Tracking who used AI assistance\n- **Compliance**: Meeting requirements for AI-generated content attribution\n\nSo the `human_author` parameter doesn't change **what** content is attributed to whom - it just tracks **who** was responsible for initiating the AI session that generated that content.",

So if Alice created AI content in the original commit, but Bob amends it, the authorship log will incorrectly show Bob as the human author for Alice's AI sessions.\n\n## The Fix\n\nWe should **preserve the original human author** from the checkpoints rather than overriding it.

Let me verify this by checking what happens in our test case:\n\n## Test Case Analysis\n\nIn our test:\n1. **Original commit**: Made by \"Test User <test@example.com>\" (human author)\n2. **AI checkpoint**: Created with AI agent, but no existing authorship log\n3. **Amend**: We pass \"Test User <test@example.com>\" as `human_author`\n\nSince there's no existing authorship log for the original commit, the prompt record gets created with the `human_author` we pass.\n\n## The Real Issue\n\nThe issue you're pointing out would occur if:\n1. **Original commit**: Made by Alice, with AI content\n2. **Amend**: Made by Bob\n3. **Our code**: Passes Bob as `human_author`\n\nIn this case, Bob would overwrite Alice's attribution for the AI sessions.\n\n## The Correct Fix\n\nWe should **not** pass the amending user as `human_author`. Instead, we should pass `None` to preserve the original attribution:\n\n```rust\nVirtualAttributions::from_working_log_for_commit(\n    repo_clone,\n    original_commit.to_string(),\n    &pathspecs,\n    None, // Don't override original human attribution\n)\n```\n\nThis way, the original human author (Alice) is preserved, and only new AI sessions created during the amend would get attributed to the amending user (Bob).\n\nWould you like me to make this fix?",

In an amend scenario, we're not creating new checkpoints during the amend process. The amend just applies the existing working log checkpoints to the authorship log.\n\nSo actually, we should pass `None` to preserve the original human attribution, and the amending user doesn't need to be attributed to any AI content since they're not creating new AI content - they're just applying existing checkpoints.\n\nWould you like me to make this fix?",

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### ✅ **Human Author Attribution Fix**\n\n**Problem**: The `human_author` parameter was being applied to all AI sessions, including ones from the original commit, which would overwrite the original human attribution.\n\n**Solution**: Implemented smart logic that:\n- **Preserves original attribution**: If the original commit has existing AI sessions with human authors, those are preserved (`None` passed to avoid overwriting)\n- **Applies to new content**: If the original commit has no AI sessions (empty authorship log), the amending user is used as the human author\n\n**Logic**:\n```rust\nlet has_existing_prompts = if has_existing_log {\n    let original_log = get_reference_as_authorship_log_v3(repo, original_commit).unwrap();\n    !original_log.metadata.prompts.is_empty()\n} else {\n    false\n};\n\n// Only use amending user if no existing AI sessions to preserve\nif has_existing_prompts { None } else { Some(_human_author.clone()) }\n```\n\n### ✅ **Code Cleanup**\n\n- Removed all debug logging\n- Cleaned up unused imports (`merge_attributions_favoring_first`, `HashMap`)\n- Removed unused commit objects\n- Simplified the implementation\n\n### ✅ **Test Results**\n\nAll amend tests pass:\n```\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_add_lines_at_bottom ... ok\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_add_lines_in_middle ... ok  \ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_add_lines_at_top ... ok\ntest authorship::rebase_authorship::tests::test_amend_multiple_changes ... ignored\n```\n\n### **Final Behavior**\n\nThe commit amend logic now correctly:\n1. **Preserves original human attribution** for existing AI sessions\n2. **Applies amending user attribution** only to new AI sessions (when no existing sessions exist)\n3. **Maintains proper audit trails** showing who initiated each AI session\n4. **Uses the Virtual Attribution system** for cleaner, more maintainable code\n\nThe implementation is now ready for use and properly handles the human author attribution as requested!",

Let me summarize what I've learned:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n1. **CherryPickEvent already exists** in `rewrite_log.rs` but is unused\n2. **No cherry-pick hooks exist** - need to create them\n3. **Pattern from rebase** is well-established:\n   - Pre-hook captures original state\n   - Post-hook detects completion/abort/in-progress\n   - Uses Start/Complete/Abort event pattern for multi-step operations\n   - Uses rewrite log to track state across continuations\n4. **Git cherry-pick state tracking**:\n   - `.git/CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` exists during conflicts or multi-commit picks\n   - `.git/sequencer/` directory tracks multi-commit sequence\n5. **Authorship reconstruction approach**: hanging commit + blame is proven\n\n## Questions for the user:\n\nBefore creating the plan, I need to clarify the event structure for cherry-pick since the current `CherryPickEvent` only tracks a single commit, but cherry-pick can apply multiple commits.\n\n1. For the rewrite log events, should we follow the rebase pattern with Start/Complete/Abort events, or use the simpler single-event pattern like the existing CherryPickEvent?\n   - a) Rebase-style: CherryPickStart, CherryPickComplete, CherryPickAbort (tracks multiple commits as a sequence)\n   - b) Single event: Keep existing CherryPickEvent structure (one event per commit)\n\n2. When cherry-picking multiple commits (e.g., `git cherry-pick A B C`), how should we structure the mapping?\n   - a) Process all at completion as a batch with array of (source_commit -> new_commit) mappings\n   - b) Process each commit individually as it's created (similar to how rebase processes commit-by-commit)"

Let me clarify the mapping logic in the plan:\n\nWhen `git cherry-pick A B C` runs:\n- A gets applied to current HEAD → creates A'\n- B gets applied to A' → creates B' \n- C gets applied to B' → creates C'\n\n**For the implementation:**\n\nThe **git command itself** handles the sequential shifting (A → A', B on top of A' → B', etc.). We don't need to manually iterate during authorship reconstruction.\n\nIn our hooks:\n1. **Pre-hook**: Capture original_head and source_commits [A, B, C]\n2. **Git does its thing** (sequential application with potential conflicts/continues)\n3. **Post-hook**: Build mapping by walking from new_head back to original_head to get [A', B', C'], then zip with [A, B, C] to get pairs\n\nThe authorship reconstruction for each pair is independent because each new commit already has the correct tree (git already applied the changes). We just use the source commit as the \"blame context\" via the hanging commit approach.\n\n**One edge case to handle**: If there are conflicts and the user resolves/continues multiple times, the sequencer tracks this. The post-hook detects \"still in progress\" via `.git/sequencer/` existing and waits. Only when fully complete (sequencer gone) do we build final mappings.\n\nThe plan already accounts for this with the \"check if still in progress\" logic. Does this clarify the approach? Should I proceed with implementation, or do you want to discuss the mapping logic further?"

Here's what was completed:\n\n### ✅ Implementation Complete\n\n1. **Updated RewriteLogEvent Types** (`src/git/rewrite_log.rs`)\n   - Replaced single `CherryPick` event with `CherryPickStart`, `CherryPickComplete`, and `CherryPickAbort`\n   - Added proper event structs with source/new commit tracking\n   - Updated tests to use new event types\n\n2. **Created Cherry-Pick Hooks** (`src/commands/hooks/cherry_pick_hooks.rs`)\n   - Pre-hook: Captures original HEAD and source commits, logs Start event\n   - Post-hook: Detects completion/abort, builds commit mappings, triggers authorship rewrite\n   - Handles conflicts with `--continue` and `--abort`\n   - Parses various cherry-pick formats (single, multiple, ranges like `A..C`)\n\n3. **Added Authorship Rewrite Logic** (`src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs`)\n   - New `rewrite_authorship_after_cherry_pick()` function\n   - Reuses existing infrastructure (`rewrite_single_commit_authorship`)\n   - Handles 1:1 mappings and empty commits gracefully\n\n4. **Wired Up Hooks** (`src/commands/git_handlers.rs`, `src/commands/hooks/mod.rs`)\n   - Integrated pre/post hooks into git command flow\n   - Registered cherry_pick_hooks module\n\n5. **Added Test Helpers** (`src/git/test_utils/mod.rs`)\n   - `cherry_pick()`: Basic cherry-pick operation\n   - `cherry_pick_with_conflicts()`: Test conflict scenarios\n   - `cherry_pick_continue()`: Continue after resolving conflicts\n   - `cherry_pick_abort()`: Abort operation\n\n6. **Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/cherry_pick.rs`)\n   - Single commit cherry-pick\n   - Multiple commits in sequence\n   - Cherry-pick with conflicts and --continue\n   - Cherry-pick --abort\n   - Cherry-pick without AI authorship\n   - Multiple AI sessions preservation\n   - Trees-identical fast path\n   - Empty commits handling\n\n7. **Updated Documentation** (`docs/limitations.mdx`)\n   - Changed cherry-pick support from ❌ to ✅\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Sequential handling**: Properly tracks A → A', B → B', C → C' transformations\n- **Conflict support**: Detects in-progress state via `.git/CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` and `.git/sequencer/`\n- **Reconstruction**: Uses hanging commit + blame approach (same as rebase)\n- **Fast path**: Copies authorship log when trees are identical\n- **Graceful degradation**: Handles missing authorship logs, empty commits, etc.\n\nThe implementation follows the proven rebase pattern and successfully preserves AI authorship attribution through cherry-pick operations!"

          "text": "Excellent! All tests still pass. Here's what I fixed:\n\n## The Problem\n\nDuring cherry-pick with conflicts, when you partially resolved the conflict and committed, the authorship reconstruction tried to blame lines that didn't exist in the \"hanging commit\" (the temporary commit used for blame context). In your case, it tried to blame line 30 in a file that only had 26 lines.\n\n## The Root Cause\n\nWhen the code couldn't find an inserted line in the hanging commit, it used a fallback calculation: `new_line + (i as u32)`. This could produce line numbers beyond the file's actual bounds, especially after conflict resolution when the file structure differs from expectations.\n\n## The Fix\n\nI added two safety mechanisms in `src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs`:\n\n1. **Bounds checking**: Before trying to blame a line, verify it's within the hanging commit's line count\n2. **Graceful error handling**: If blame fails (e.g., file doesn't exist or line is out of bounds), log it and continue processing other lines instead of failing the entire operation\n\nNow when you cherry-pick with conflicts:\n- Lines that can't be mapped to the hanging commit are skipped with a debug message\n- Blame errors are caught and logged instead of crashing\n- The cherry-pick completes successfully, even if some lines can't have their authorship reconstructed\n\nThis is reasonable because if a line doesn't exist in the original commit's context (the hanging commit), we genuinely can't reconstruct its authorship history - it's a new line from the conflict resolution."

          "type": "assistant",
          "text": "Excellent! You were absolutely right. The code is now much simpler and more logical:\n\n**Before (with unnecessary fallback):**\n- Try to match line in hanging commit\n- If no match, calculate a fallback line number based on the new file position\n- Check if that line is in bounds\n- Try to blame it anyway (which makes no sense - why blame a random line?)\n\n**After (clean logic):**\n- Try to match line in hanging commit\n- If match found: blame it to get historical authorship\n- If no match: skip it (it's a new line, no historical authorship to reconstruct)\n\nThe fallback was indeed pointless - if an inserted line doesn't exist in the hanging commit, there's simply no historical authorship to reconstruct. It's a genuinely new line, likely from conflict resolution or new changes in the cherry-picked commit. We should just skip it and move on.\n\nThis also fixes your original error cleanly: lines that can't be found in the hanging commit are simply skipped, so we never try to blame line 30 in a 26-line file."
