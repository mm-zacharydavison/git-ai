Here's what I changed:\n\n## Summary of Changes:\n\n1. **Created a new `ResetKind` enum** with three variants: `Hard`, `Soft`, and `Mixed` (serialized as lowercase strings)\n\n2. **Created a new unified `ResetEvent` struct** with the fields you specified:\n   - `kind: ResetKind` - the type of reset (hard, soft, or mixed)\n   - `keep: bool` - whether --keep flag was used\n   - `merge: bool` - whether --merge flag was used\n   - `new_head_sha: String` - where HEAD moved to\n   - `old_head_sha: String` - where HEAD started from\n\n3. **Replaced the two enum variants** `ResetSoft` and `ResetHard` with a single `Reset` variant\n\n4. **Updated the helper method** from `reset_soft()` and `reset_hard()` to a single `reset()` method\n\n5. **Removed the old structs** `ResetSoftEvent` and `ResetHardEvent`\n\nThe changes compile successfully with no linter errors, and there were no existing usages of the old types in the codebase to update. The new structure provides a more flexible and unified way to track all types of git reset operations with their various flags."
