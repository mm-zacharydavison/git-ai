          "text": "The `unknown` in the target name is actually **normal** â€” it's part of Rust's standard target triple format: `architecture-vendor-os-environment`. For example, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` means ARM64 architecture, unknown vendor, Linux OS, and GNU environment.\n\nHowever, your **actual problem** is that you're trying to build an **ARM64 (aarch64) binary on an x64 Linux machine without the necessary cross-compilation tools installed**. The error shows it can't find `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`, which is the ARM64 cross-compiler.\n\nHere's what's happening in your workflow:\n\n```230:230:.github/workflows/release.yml\n- os: ubuntu-latest\n  target: aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu\n  artifact_name: git-ai-linux-arm64\n```\n\nUbuntu-latest runs on x64, so it can't natively compile ARM64 binaries. You have two options:\n\n**Option 1: Use the `cross` tool (Recommended - easier)**\nThe `cross` crate handles cross-compilation automatically with Docker containers.\n\n**Option 2: Install cross-compilation tools**\nAdd a step to install `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` and related packages.\n\nWhich approach would you prefer? I'd recommend **Option 1** with `cross` as it's more reliable and handles all the toolchain setup automatically. I can update your workflow to use it if you'd like.\n\nAlso note: If you want to build native ARM64 binaries, you could alternatively use GitHub's macOS ARM64 runners (which are available), or wait for native ARM64 Linux runners if you have access to them.",

GitHub Actions now offers **native ARM64 Linux runners** (as of September 2024), but **they're only available on Team and Enterprise Cloud plans**, not the free tier.\n\nIf you have access to those plans, you can change your workflow to build natively on ARM64 by updating the `runs-on` field:\n\n```yaml\n- os: ubuntu-22.04-arm64  # ARM64 native runner\n  target: aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu\n  artifact_name: git-ai-linux-arm64\n```\n\n**However, if you don't have access to ARM64 runners**, here are your alternatives:\n\n1. **Use `cross` tool (Recommended)** â€” Cross-compile with Docker containers (free, works on any plan)\n2. **Use self-hosted runners** â€” Run your own ARM64 machine as a GitHub Actions runner\n3. **Skip ARM64 Linux builds** â€” Just remove that build target if you don't need it\n\nWould you like me to update your workflow to use the `cross` tool instead?

This means your ARM64 Linux builds will now run natively on ARM64 hardware instead of trying to cross-compile from x64.\n\nYour workflow should work much better now! The builds will:\n- âœ… Run natively on ARM64 architecture (no cross-compilation needed)\n- âœ… Be available for free in your public repository\n- âœ… Potentially deliver up to 40% performance boost according to GitHub\n\nThe only thing to note is that ARM64 runners are currently in public preview, so you might experience longer queue times during peak hours, but it's definitely the right approach!",
