Let me summarize what was done:\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\nI've successfully parallelized the authorship push with the main git push command. Here's what was implemented:\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n1. **Updated `CommandHooksContext` structure** (`src/commands/git_handlers.rs`):\n   - Added `push_authorship_handle: Option<std::thread::JoinHandle<()>>` field to store the background thread handle\n\n2. **Created `push_pre_command_hook` function** (`src/commands/hooks/push_hooks.rs`):\n   - Extracts remote detection logic from the old post-hook\n   - Spawns a background thread using `std::thread::spawn()` to push authorship notes in parallel with the main push\n   - Returns the thread handle to be stored in the context\n   - Handles all edge cases (dry-run, delete, mirror flags)\n\n3. **Refactored `push_post_command_hook` function** (`src/commands/hooks/push_hooks.rs`):\n   - Now takes `command_hooks_context` parameter\n   - Waits for the background thread to complete using `handle.join()`\n   - Errors from authorship push are logged but don't affect the exit code\n   - Maintains all existing skip logic\n\n4. **Wired up the pre-hook** (`src/commands/git_handlers.rs`):\n   - Added \"push\" case to `run_pre_command_hooks()` that calls `push_pre_command_hook()`\n\n5. **Updated post-hook call site** (`src/commands/git_handlers.rs`):\n   - Modified the \"push\" case in `run_post_command_hooks()` to pass `command_hooks_context`\n\n### Key Design Decisions:\n\n- **Used `std::thread` instead of `smol` async**: This avoids Send/Sync issues with the `Repository` struct which contains libgit2 objects\n- **Background thread recreates repository**: Uses `find_repository()` with the global args to get a fresh `Repository` instance in the background thread\n- **Error handling**: Authorship push failures are logged with `debug_log` but don't affect the main push exit code\n- **Parallel execution**: The authorship push now runs concurrently with the main git push command, improving performance\n\nThe code compiles successfully with no errors. The authorship notes will now be pushed in parallel with the main push operation, and any failures won't impact the user's push result.",

This means:\n1. The background thread keeps running after the main process may have exited\n2. We don't properly clean up the thread\n\nThe early returns for dry-run/delete/mirror are fine (they prevent starting the thread in the first place), but the post-hook shouldn't skip waiting if the thread was already started.

The key is that we're pushing to **different refs**:\n\n1. **Main push**: Pushes to something like `refs/heads/main` (your branch)\n2. **Authorship push**: Pushes to `refs/notes/ai` (the notes ref)\n\nGit servers use **per-ref locking**, not repository-wide locking. So:\n\n- ✅ Pushes to **different refs** can happen in **parallel** on the server\n- ⚠️ Pushes to the **same ref** would be serialized by the server's ref lock\n\nSince we're pushing to different refs (`refs/heads/main` vs `refs/notes/ai`), they won't block each other on the server side. Both network transfers can happen concurrently, and the server can update both refs in parallel.\n\n**The real benefit**: Network I/O parallelization. Even if there's some server-side serialization (like pack file operations), the network transfer time for both pushes happens concurrently. If each push takes 2 seconds of network time, running them in parallel saves ~2 seconds vs sequential.\n\nSo yes, the parallelization here is meaningful because:\n1. Different refs = no lock contention\n2. Network I/O overlaps\n3. Server-side operations on different refs can proceed independently\n\nThe atomic \"one writer at a time\" only applies **per ref**, not for the entire repository.",
