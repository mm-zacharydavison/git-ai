Here's a summary of the changes:\n\n## Bug Fix Summary\n\n### Problem\nThe rebase commit mapping logic had a critical flaw when handling squashed commits (N→M where N > M):\n1. **Line 531-541 in `git_handlers.rs`**: Only passed the last original commit when detecting squashing, discarding authorship from all other commits\n2. **Line 325 in `rebase_authorship.rs`**: Used simple `zip()` which couldn't handle many-to-few mappings\n\n### Solution\n\n**1. Fixed `build_rebase_commit_mappings` in `git_handlers.rs` (lines 531-533)**\n- Removed the lossy special case that kept only the last commit\n- Now passes ALL commits through to the authorship rewriting logic\n- Simplified the code to let the authorship layer handle different mapping scenarios\n\n**2. Enhanced `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase` in `rebase_authorship.rs` (lines 322-383)**\n- Added detection for many-to-few mappings (`original_commits.len() > new_commits.len()`)\n- Created new `handle_squashed_rebase()` function to properly reconstruct authorship when commits are squashed\n- For squashed commits, uses the head of original commits (which contains all accumulated changes) to reconstruct authorship for each new commit\n- Maintains the existing 1:1 mapping logic for normal rebases\n\n### Result\n- ✅ Authorship information from all original commits is now preserved during squashing\n- ✅ Handles N→1 squashing (multiple commits to one)\n- ✅ Handles N→M squashing (multiple commits to fewer commits)\n- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with 1:1 rebases\n- ✅ Code compiles successfully with no new warnings\n\nThe fix ensures that when performing interactive rebases with squashing, the authorship reconstruction will use the complete history from all original commits rather than losing information from all but the last commit."

Let me create a quick summary of the fix:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've fixed the bug where authorship attribution could be lost during rebase operations, particularly when commits are split or added during interactive rebases.\n\n### The Problem\nThe original code used `zip()` to pair up original and new commits in a 1:1 fashion. However, `zip()` truncates to the length of the shorter iterator. This meant:\n- When `original_commits.len() < new_commits.len()` (commit splitting or adding new commits), the extra new commits were **never processed**, losing their authorship attribution.\n\n### The Solution\nI modified `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase` in `src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs` to handle three distinct cases:\n\n1. **Many-to-few** (`original > new`): Squashing commits → uses `handle_squashed_rebase()`\n2. **Few-to-many** (`original < new`): **NEW** - Splitting/adding commits → uses new `handle_split_rebase()` \n3. **One-to-one** (`original == new`): Normal rebase → uses `zip()` safely\n\nI also added the `handle_split_rebase()` function which reconstructs authorship for all new commits by using the head of the original commits as the source, ensuring no attribution is lost during commit splitting or addition operations.\n\n### Changes Made\n- Modified `rewrite_authorship_after_rebase()` to explicitly handle all three mapping scenarios\n- Added `handle_split_rebase()` function to handle commit splitting/addition cases\n- Added debug logging to identify which rebase scenario is being processed\n\nThe fix ensures that all new commits from a rebase operation will have their authorship properly tracked, regardless of whether commits were squashed, split, or kept 1:1."

For the rewrite log events, should we follow the rebase pattern with Start/Complete/Abort events, or use the simpler single-event pattern like the existing CherryPickEvent?\n   - a) Rebase-style: CherryPickStart, CherryPickComplete, CherryPickAbort (tracks multiple commits as a sequence)\n   - b) Single event: Keep existing CherryPickEvent structure (one event per commit)\n\n2. When cherry-picking multiple commits (e.g., `git cherry-pick A B C`), how should we structure the mapping?\n   - a) Process all at completion as a batch with array of (source_commit -> new_commit) mappings\n   - b) Process each commit individually as it's created (similar to how rebase processes commit-by-commit)"

We don't need to manually iterate during authorship reconstruction.\n\nIn our hooks:\n1. **Pre-hook**: Capture original_head and source_commits [A, B, C]\n2. **Git does its thing** (sequential application with potential conflicts/continues)\n3. **Post-hook**: Build mapping by walking from new_head back to original_head to get [A', B', C'], then zip with [A, B, C] to get pairs\n\nThe authorship reconstruction for each pair is independent because each new commit already has the correct tree (git already applied the changes). We just use the source commit as the \"blame context\" via the hanging commit approach.\n\n**One edge case to handle**: If there are conflicts and the user resolves/continues multiple times, the sequencer tracks this. The post-hook detects \"still in progress\" via `.git/sequencer/` existing and waits. Only when fully complete (sequencer gone) do we build final mappings.\n\nThe plan already accounts for this with the \"check if still in progress\" logic. Does this clarify the approach?

Let me create a summary of what we've accomplished:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented comprehensive cherry-pick authorship support for git-ai. Here's what was completed:\n\n### ✅ Implementation Complete\n\n1. **Updated RewriteLogEvent Types** (`src/git/rewrite_log.rs`)\n   - Replaced single `CherryPick` event with `CherryPickStart`, `CherryPickComplete`, and `CherryPickAbort`\n   - Added proper event structs with source/new commit tracking\n   - Updated tests to use new event types\n\n2. **Created Cherry-Pick Hooks** (`src/commands/hooks/cherry_pick_hooks.rs`)\n   - Pre-hook: Captures original HEAD and source commits, logs Start event\n   - Post-hook: Detects completion/abort, builds commit mappings, triggers authorship rewrite\n   - Handles conflicts with `--continue` and `--abort`\n   - Parses various cherry-pick formats (single, multiple, ranges like `A..C`)\n\n3. **Added Authorship Rewrite Logic** (`src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs`)\n   - New `rewrite_authorship_after_cherry_pick()` function\n   - Reuses existing infrastructure (`rewrite_single_commit_authorship`)\n   - Handles 1:1 mappings and empty commits gracefully\n\n4. **Wired Up Hooks** (`src/commands/git_handlers.rs`, `src/commands/hooks/mod.rs`)\n   - Integrated pre/post hooks into git command flow\n   - Registered cherry_pick_hooks module\n\n5. **Added Test Helpers** (`src/git/test_utils/mod.rs`)\n   - `cherry_pick()`: Basic cherry-pick operation\n   - `cherry_pick_with_conflicts()`: Test conflict scenarios\n   - `cherry_pick_continue()`: Continue after resolving conflicts\n   - `cherry_pick_abort()`: Abort operation\n\n6. **Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/cherry_pick.rs`)\n   - Single commit cherry-pick\n   - Multiple commits in sequence\n   - Cherry-pick with conflicts and --continue\n   - Cherry-pick --abort\n   - Cherry-pick without AI authorship\n   - Multiple AI sessions preservation\n   - Trees-identical fast path\n   - Empty commits handling\n\n7. **Updated Documentation** (`docs/limitations.mdx`)\n   - Changed cherry-pick support from ❌ to ✅\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Sequential handling**: Properly tracks A → A', B → B', C → C' transformations\n- **Conflict support**: Detects in-progress state via `.git/CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` and `.git/sequencer/`\n- **Reconstruction**: Uses hanging commit + blame approach (same as rebase)\n- **Fast path**: Copies authorship log when trees are identical\n- **Graceful degradation**: Handles missing authorship logs, empty commits, etc.\n\nThe implementation follows the proven rebase pattern and successfully preserves AI authorship attribution through cherry-pick operations!"

Here's what I fixed:\n\n## The Problem\n\nDuring cherry-pick with conflicts, when you partially resolved the conflict and committed, the authorship reconstruction tried to blame lines that didn't exist in the \"hanging commit\" (the temporary commit used for blame context). In your case, it tried to blame line 30 in a file that only had 26 lines.\n\n## The Root Cause\n\nWhen the code couldn't find an inserted line in the hanging commit, it used a fallback calculation: `new_line + (i as u32)`. This could produce line numbers beyond the file's actual bounds, especially after conflict resolution when the file structure differs from expectations.\n\n## The Fix\n\nI added two safety mechanisms in `src/authorship/rebase_authorship.rs`:\n\n1. **Bounds checking**: Before trying to blame a line, verify it's within the hanging commit's line count\n2. **Graceful error handling**: If blame fails (e.g., file doesn't exist or line is out of bounds), log it and continue processing other lines instead of failing the entire operation\n\nNow when you cherry-pick with conflicts:\n- Lines that can't be mapped to the hanging commit are skipped with a debug message\n- Blame errors are caught and logged instead of crashing\n- The cherry-pick completes successfully, even if some lines can't have their authorship reconstructed\n\nThis is reasonable because if a line doesn't exist in the original commit's context (the hanging commit), we genuinely can't reconstruct its authorship history - it's a new line from the conflict resolution."

The code is now much simpler and more logical:\n\n**Before (with unnecessary fallback):**\n- Try to match line in hanging commit\n- If no match, calculate a fallback line number based on the new file position\n- Check if that line is in bounds\n- Try to blame it anyway (which makes no sense - why blame a random line?)\n\n**After (clean logic):**\n- Try to match line in hanging commit\n- If match found: blame it to get historical authorship\n- If no match: skip it (it's a new line, no historical authorship to reconstruct)\n\nThe fallback was indeed pointless - if an inserted line doesn't exist in the hanging commit, there's simply no historical authorship to reconstruct. It's a genuinely new line, likely from conflict resolution or new changes in the cherry-picked commit. We should just skip it and move on.\n\nThis also fixes your original error cleanly: lines that can't be found in the hanging commit are simply skipped, so we never try to blame line 30 in a 26-line file."
