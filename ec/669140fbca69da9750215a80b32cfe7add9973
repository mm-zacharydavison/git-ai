I need to create a progress bar similar to `write_stats_to_terminal`\n3. I need to handle three cases:\n   - All commits have authorship logs - show graph only\n   - Some commits don't have logs - show graph + breakdown of commits without logs\n   - No commits have logs - show \"Committers are not using git-ai\"\n\nLet me implement this:",

We need to modify the approach. Let me check if I should modify the `RangeAuthorshipStats` structure or handle it differently:\n\nLooking at the implementation, I see that in lines 118-124, the authors are being extracted from `CommitAuthorship::NoLog` variants. Since we're losing the per-commit mapping, I need to either:\n1. Modify `AuthorshipStats` to preserve the commit -> author mapping\n2.

Now let me create a comprehensive summary document of the changes made:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the `print_range_authorship_stats` function as requested. Here's what was done:\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n1. **Modified `AuthorshipStats` struct** (lines 14-22 in range_authorship.rs):\n   - Added a new field `commits_without_authorship_with_authors: Vec<(String, String)>` to preserve the mapping between commit SHAs and their authors\n   - This allows us to display the correct author information for each commit without authorship logs\n\n2. **Updated `range_authorship` function** (lines 104-135):\n   - Modified to populate the new `commits_without_authorship_with_authors` field\n   - Extracts commit SHA and author from `CommitAuthorship::NoLog` variants\n\n3. **Implemented `print_range_authorship_stats` function** (lines 446-533):\n   - **Case 1: No commits have authorship logs** - Displays: `\"Committers are not using git-ai\"`\n   - **Case 2: Some or all commits have authorship logs** - Displays:\n     - A progress bar showing human vs AI contributions using block characters (█ for human, ░ for AI)\n     - A percentage line showing the exact percentages\n     - Total commit count\n     - If some commits lack authorship logs:\n       - The count of commits without authorship logs\n       - A breakdown listing each commit SHA and its author\n\n4. **Updated `git_ai_handlers.rs`** (line 391):\n   - Changed from debug printing to calling `print_range_authorship_stats(&stats)` for proper formatted output\n\n### Output Examples:\n\n**All commits using git-ai:**\n```\nyou  ████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ ai\n     75%                                  25%\ncounted 9 commits\n```\n\n**Some commits without authorship:**\n```\nyou  ████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ ai\n     75%                                  25%\ncounted 9 commits\n  2 commits without Authorship Logs\n    xyz1234 Aidan Cunniffe <acunniffe@gmail.com>\n    abc1344 Pauly G <paulyg@gmail.com>\n```\n\n**No commits using git-ai:**\n```\nCommitters are not using git-ai\n```\n\nThe implementation compiles successfully with no errors and is ready for use!",
