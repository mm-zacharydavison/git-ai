Here's the performance comparison:\n\n**Current approach (Vec):**\n- Complexity: O(m √ó n) where m = number of remotes, n = number of allowed repos\n- `Vec::contains` does a linear search\n\n**Better approach (HashSet):**\n- Complexity: O(m) where m = number of remotes\n- `HashSet::contains` is O(1) on average\n\nFor a small allow list (< 10 repos), the difference is negligible. But since this check potentially runs on every git command, using a `HashSet` is a better choice. Let me update it:"

But it's the right data structure for the job since we're primarily doing membership checks, not iterating or preserving order."

Empty list ‚Üí allow all (or block all, depending on design)\n2. Remote matches list ‚Üí **allow** (true)\n3.
